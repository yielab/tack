# Part VIII handoffs — Docket bridge hardening (Phase 62)

**Read this file's header and your card's block. Nothing else in it.** It exists so a card
agent spends its context on the card, not on discovering what to read. Everything about
*how* to work a card is identical to Part VII's and is restated here only where it differs.

One handoff per card, named `VIII-<card>.md`, written from [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md).
Each card writes **exactly one**; corrections are dated amendments. No card edits the board
in `TODO.md`; the wave integrator does, after independent verification.

The board is `TODO.md` → **Part VIII**, §VIII.0–§VIII.6 (it sits **above** Part VII). The
decisions of record are `docs/adr/0060-docket-control-plane-disposition.md` (accepted
2026-08-31) and `docs/adr/0065-docket-pipeline-dispatch-trigger.md` (accepted 2026-09-08 —
binding on VIII-A2 only).

## What this Part is, in one paragraph

ADR 0060 decided the Docket bridge stays: maintained, optional, and never the owner of a
runner-v1 execution request. It left four things unfinished, and every card here closes
exactly one of them. **No card adds a new Docket surface.** A card that finds itself
designing one has left the Part — write the question in the handoff and stop.

## Waves, order, and the base to branch from

| Wave | Cards | Parallel? | Needs | Base SHA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 24 | VIII-A1 · VIII-B1 · VIII-B2 · VIII-C1 | yes — four disjoint file sets | nothing beyond ADR 0060 | `1b9b7e6` + the 2026-09-08 planning commit; **pin `git rev-parse --short develop` at dispatch**, not this line |
| 25 | VIII-A2 · VIII-B3 | yes — disjoint files | ADR 0065 accepted (it is), plus VIII-A1 and VIII-B2 integrated (they are) | `7890673` |
| 26 | VIII-C2 · VIII-A3 | yes — disjoint files | Wave 25 integrated (it is) | `0002136` |

**Integration line: `develop`.** Every card branches as `agent/viii-<card>-<slug>`
(`agent/viii-a1-dispatch`, `agent/viii-b1-mirror-guard`, …) and never merges itself.

## Rules that bite in this Part specifically

1. **`../rack-cli` is docket's repository. Read it; never write to it.** It is a separate
   git repo. Nothing from it is ever committed into this tree. When a card needs to know
   what docket sends or accepts, `../rack-cli/src/docket/` is the contract — not a Tack DTO,
   not a fixture, not this file's prose.
2. **Never touch `~/.docket`.** It holds the user's real approvals and audit log, and a
   worktree of this very repo. A card that runs docket sets `DOCKET_HOME` to a temporary
   directory it owns and names that directory in its handoff.
3. **`cargo` writes outside `/home`.** That partition is 94% full (41G free) and this tree's
   `target/` is already 87G. Export the `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` your dispatch prompt pins before
   the first build. **A card that fills the disk fails the whole wave, not just itself.**
4. **`.githooks/pre-push` is the definition of done.** Run it. A green test suite is not a
   finished change — `cargo fmt`, `check-comments.sh` and `check-test-hygiene.sh` are part of
   the gate, and formatting is invisible until a push is attempted.
5. **Comments explain the code, never the board.** No card ids, wave numbers, dates or
   `TODO.md §` references in any comment you write. `check-comments.sh` enforces it.
6. **Never read `TODO.md` whole** (~199k tokens). Extract your Part with
   `grep -n "^# \|^## " TODO.md`, then `sed -n '<start>,<end>p'` for §VIII only.

## Card blocks

### VIII-A1 — `DocketAdapter::dispatch`, implemented

Board: `TODO.md` §VIII.4 → VIII-A1. Owns the `dispatch` method and the "Write methods"
paragraph in `crates/tack-orch/src/adapters/docket.rs`, the `dispatch` trait doc in
`crates/tack-orch/src/lib.rs`, and new cases in `crates/tack-orch/tests/docket_adapter_test.rs`
and `docket_wire_contract_test.rs`.

Read, in this order: the module doc of `adapters/docket.rs` (its "Write methods" and
"Verified live" sections), `../rack-cli/src/docket/serve.py`'s `do_POST` (the
`/dispatch/` branch — **this is the contract**), then `enqueue_task`'s implementation in the
same adapter as the shape to mirror. Do not read the reconciler.

The one trap: `enqueue_task` deliberately does not parse fields its signature cannot carry.
`dispatch` returns `Result<String, OrchError>` — the run id and nothing else. Do not widen
the trait signature.

### VIII-B1 — the mirror guard, enforced

Board: `TODO.md` §VIII.4 → VIII-B1. Owns `crates/tack-api/src/handlers/executions.rs`, one
read-only query in `crates/tack-db/src/repo/orch.rs`,
`crates/tack-api/tests/orchestration/dispatch/dual_scheduling.rs`, and the "One scheduling
owner" paragraph of `crates/tack-orch/src/adapters/legacy_bridge.rs`.

Read, in this order: `legacy_bridge.rs`'s "One scheduling owner" section (it states the gap
you are closing, in bold), `dispatcher.rs` around line 327 (the guard in the *other*
direction — mirror its shape), the existing `dual_scheduling.rs`, then `repo/orch.rs` for how
`orch_tasks` is queried today.

The one trap: with `TACK_ORCH_ENABLE` off, a stale `orch_tasks` row must **not** block
runner-v1 — that would invert "runner-v1 is the plan of record". Acceptance 3 requires a
test for both states.

### VIII-B2 — the compatibility decision reaches an operator

Board: `TODO.md` §VIII.4 → VIII-B2. Owns one response shape in
`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/orch.rs`, its renderer under
`frontend/src/features/settings/orchestration/`, the regenerated `docs/openapi.json` and
`frontend/src/shared/api/schema.gen.ts`, and one new case under `crates/tack-api/tests/orchestration/`.

Read, in this order: `legacy_bridge.rs`'s constants and the doc comments above them (they
say what the label is *for*, including that no route surfaces it today), then
`handlers/orch.rs` to choose which response carries it.

The one trap: the label must be **imported from `tack_orch::adapters::legacy_bridge`**, never
re-typed as a string literal, and a test must assert the response equals the constant. A
copied literal is exactly how the decision and the wire drift apart.

### VIII-C1 — measure the `orch_*_new` claim, then correct what repeats it

Board: `TODO.md` §VIII.4 → VIII-C1. **Documentation only.** Owns the
`orch_runs_new`/`orch_approvals_new` bullet in `.claude/scope-discipline.md` and any other
document its own grep finds repeating that claim.

Read, in this order: the `orch_*_new` bullet in `.claude/scope-discipline.md`, the
"Measurement" section of `docs/adr/0060-docket-control-plane-disposition.md` (it states the
opposite, and gives the command), then the 037/038 rebuild in `crates/tack-db/src/migrations.rs`.

The one trap: this card is the measurement, not a predetermined edit. **If the
scope-discipline bullet turns out to be right, change nothing and say so.** And whatever you
find, delete no table, migration or code — a real leftover is a finding for a new card.

### VIII-A2 — the trigger gets a caller: route, token, CLI

Board: `TODO.md` §VIII.4 → VIII-A2. Owns one new route in `crates/tack-api/src/handlers/orch.rs`
and its registration in `crates/tack-api/src/router.rs`, `TACK_ORCH_DISPATCH_TOKEN` in
`crates/tack-api/src/config.rs`, a new `orch dispatch` command in `crates/tack-cli/`,
`docs/CONFIG.md`, `docs/API-REFERENCE.md`, the regenerated `docs/openapi.json` and
`frontend/src/shared/api/schema.gen.ts`, and one new case under `crates/tack-api/tests/orchestration/`.

Read, in this order: ADR 0065's decision table **and** its "A block is not synchronously
observable on this route" section; `require_approval_token` in `handlers/orch.rs` (~line 2688)
with its doc comment — it is the fail-closed token shape you are mirroring, not inventing;
`orch_routes` in `router.rs` for where the route is registered and what gates it; then
`DocketAdapter::dispatch` in `crates/tack-orch/src/adapters/docket.rs` for the method you call.
Do not read the reconciler.

The one trap: **a run id is not a promise the run was permitted.** docket's dispatch route
answers before the pipeline runs, so no wording anywhere you write — response body, doc
comment, CLI output, API reference — may say a run was allowed, accepted, approved or
permitted. It started. The reconciler `/runs` poll is where the verdict later appears, and
that is what the operator-facing text points at.

### VIII-B3 — prove the replay case, and name the collision

Board: `TODO.md` §VIII.4 → VIII-B3. Owns the idempotent-replay case in
`crates/tack-api/tests/orchestration/dispatch/dual_scheduling.rs` and the conflict payload in
`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/executions.rs`.

Read, in this order: the mirror guard in `create_execution` (`handlers/executions.rs`) and
specifically its `existing_snapshot.is_none()` arm; `docs/agent-handoffs/part-viii/VIII-B1.md`,
which shipped that guard and records this path as untested; then the existing
`dual_scheduling.rs` for the harness the new case joins.

The one trap: the guard's condition, its status set and its enablement check are **settled** —
VIII-B1 decided them and one of them was already returned once for a silent fail-open. This
card proves a path and enriches a payload. It does not re-decide the guard.

### VIII-A3 — a dispatched run's outcome can be read back

Board: `TODO.md` §VIII.4 → VIII-A3. Owns one read route in `crates/tack-api/src/handlers/orch.rs`,
its `tack orch run` client in `crates/tack-cli/`, `docs/API-REFERENCE.md`, the regenerated
`docs/openapi.json` and `frontend/src/shared/api/schema.gen.ts`, and one new case under
`crates/tack-api/tests/orchestration/`.

Read, in this order: the board card (it carries the measurement that found this gap);
ADR 0065 decisions 5 and 7, which you are working *between* and must not re-open;
`list_orch_runs_for_item` in `handlers/orch.rs` as the item-scoped shape you are complementing;
then `Repository::get_orch_run` and its only current caller in `crates/tack-api/src/orch_store.rs`.

The one trap: this route reads **what the reconciler last mirrored**, never docket itself. Adding
an inline fetch would be the second ingestion path decision 7 forbids, and it would also make a
read route reach the network. An un-polled run is a legitimate, distinct answer — not an error,
and not a fabricated state.

### VIII-C2 — re-verify the adapter live, at the version the repo ships

Board: `TODO.md` §VIII.4 → VIII-C2. **Last card of this Part.** Owns the "Verified live
against a real docket server" section of the module doc in
`crates/tack-orch/src/adapters/docket.rs`, and its own handoff. It changes no Tack route,
type or test.

Read, in this order: the board card (it lists what must be captured and what must not be
touched); the "Verified live" section itself, which is the evidence you are re-dating;
`DocketAdapter::dispatch` in the same file (never captured live); then ADR 0065's section
"A block is not synchronously observable on this route", which is the claim acceptance 4
tests. Do not read the reconciler and do not read `handlers/orch.rs`.

The one trap: **a dispatch runs a real pod pipeline, and a pipeline spends money.** The
route answers before the work does, so the run id you are after is obtained without any of
the pipeline succeeding — give the isolated instance no working provider credential so it
fails locally instead of reaching a paid API. And `DOCKET_HOME` is a temporary directory you
own; `~/.docket` holds the user's real approvals and is never touched.
