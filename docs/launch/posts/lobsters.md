# Lobsters (draft, not posted)

**Format notes:** Lobsters submissions are a title + URL + tags, with an optional short
comment as the first reply — there's no long post body on the story itself. Suggested
tags below are a guess; check current tag list before submitting (invented tags are
rejected). This community is small, technical, and has close to zero tolerance for
promotional tone — the comment should read like an engineer describing their own
system, not pitching it.

## Story

- **Title:** `Tack: a self-hosted project manager that durably recovers a killed AI coding-agent run`
- **URL:** `https://github.com/yielab/tack`
- **Suggested tags:** `rust`, `show`, `practices` (whichever subset actually exists on
  the instance at submit time)

## First-comment text (posted immediately after submitting, as the author)

Built this because I wanted a project manager that could dispatch a board item to
Claude Code, Codex, or another coding-agent CLI against my own repo, without running
anyone else's server or handing over model credentials. The board and the runner are
separate concerns on
purpose: the board (Rust/Axum/SQLite, one binary) never executes code or holds a model
credential; a small runner process does that, pulling work over an HTTP protocol and
reporting back.

The one piece I think is worth a technical look rather than a glance: every attempt gets
a fencing token and a lease. Kill the runner mid-attempt and the board doesn't silently
lose the record or blindly re-run it — the attempt goes to `needs_operator`, and an
explicit operator decision is required before a retry happens. `docs/screenshots/recovery-demo.gif`
in the repo is a recording of that exact sequence, made from a downloaded release
binary running in two Docker containers, not a staged dev build.

Current state, honestly: 0 users outside my own testing, one contributor (me), no
accounts system (one shared bearer token), no notifications, English-only. MIT
licensed, 1,116 tests, `cargo nextest run --workspace` green. Feedback on the fencing/
lease design or the crate-boundary rules (`tack-core` has zero I/O; the orchestration
crate is structurally barred from depending on the HTTP layer) is more useful to me
right now than general reactions to the pitch.
