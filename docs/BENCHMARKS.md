# Tack — Footprint & Performance Benchmarks

_Last measured: 2026-06-25 · Tack v0.1.0-beta.6_

Tack's pitch is "fast, single-binary, self-hosted." This page replaces that claim
with numbers you can reproduce. **Everything below is one process and one SQLite
file — no Postgres, no Redis, no Docker.**

## Test machine

| | |
| --- | --- |
| CPU | 12th Gen Intel Core i5-12600K (16 threads) |
| RAM | 63 GiB |
| OS | Linux 6.14 (x86_64) |
| Build | `cargo build --release -p tack-cli --features embed-spa` (LTO, `opt-level="z"`, stripped) |

Numbers are hardware-dependent; the point is the **order of magnitude** and that
you can re-run the method below on your own box.

## Footprint

| Metric | Value | How measured |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Binary size** (UI embedded) | **10.3 MiB** | `ls -l target/release/tack` — single file, SPA embedded via `embed-spa`, stripped |
| **Binary size** (no UI) | ~3.5 MiB | release build without `embed-spa` (API + CLI only) |
| **Cold start** (launch → first `/api/health` 200) | **~113 ms** | wall-clock poll loop, fresh empty DB |
| **Idle RSS** (resident memory, settled) | **~11.7 MiB** | `VmRSS` from `/proc/<pid>/status`, 1 s after ready |

For comparison, a typical Postgres-backed PM stack starts at hundreds of MiB of
resident memory across multiple containers before the app serves a request. Tack's
whole runtime is ~12 MiB.

## Request latency

Warm latency, measured client-side over loopback (sequential unless noted). The DB
held 100 items in one project.

| Endpoint | p50 | p95 | p99 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/health` | 0.40 ms | 0.62 ms | 0.72 ms |
| `GET /api/projects/:id/items` (100 items) | 1.88 ms | 2.52 ms | 2.78 ms |
| `GET /api/projects/:id/search?q=…` (FTS5) | 1.30 ms | 1.72 ms | 1.97 ms |

Concurrent read throughput (32 client workers, `GET …/items`): **~794 req/s,
p99 ≈ 43 ms**. _Caveat: this number is bounded by the Python test client (GIL +
`urllib` overhead), not the server — treat it as a conservative floor, not a
ceiling._ For a rigorous throughput/saturation curve use the k6 baseline below.

## Reproduce it

Footprint + latency (no extra tooling needed):

```bash
# 1. Build the real single binary
cargo build --release -p tack-cli --features embed-spa
ls -l target/release/tack              # binary size

# 2. Run it from a scratch dir on an alternate port (so no tack.toml/tack.db interferes)
d=$(mktemp -d); cp target/release/tack "$d"/; cd "$d"
TACK_PORT=3211 TACK_LOG_LEVEL=warn ./tack serve &

# 3. Idle memory
awk '/VmRSS/{printf "%.1f MiB\n",$2/1024}' /proc/$!/status

# 4. Latency (sequential health probe)
python3 - <<'PY'
import urllib.request, time
u="http://127.0.0.1:3211/api/health"
for _ in range(50): urllib.request.urlopen(u).read()
t=[]
for _ in range(1000):
    s=time.perf_counter(); urllib.request.urlopen(u).read(); t.append((time.perf_counter()-s)*1000)
t.sort(); print(f"p50={t[499]:.2f}ms p99={t[989]:.2f}ms")
PY
```

> **Gotcha:** if a `tack.toml` exists in the working directory, it **overrides**
> `TACK_*` env vars (including `TACK_PORT`/`TACK_DATABASE_URL`). Always benchmark
> from a scratch directory, as above.

For load/saturation testing, use the committed k6 baseline:

```bash
make load     # tests/load/ — k6 scenario against a running server
```

## Notes & honesty

- Measured on one machine; your mileage varies with CPU, disk, and dataset size.
- SQLite is single-writer; these are **read-dominant** numbers. Write-heavy,
  highly-concurrent workloads are not Tack's target (it's built for solo devs and
  small teams — see the README positioning).
- The concurrent figure is client-limited (see caveat above); it is **not** a
  server saturation result. Replace it with a k6 run for a real ceiling.
