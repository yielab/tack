# Part VI handoffs — Agent Onboarding & Provider UX (Phase 60)

**Read this file's header and your card's block. Nothing else in it.** The whole file is
~8k tokens (measured: `wc -c` ÷ 4); the header is ~1k and a card's block ~1k. It exists so that a card agent — a Sonnet with a 200k
window — spends its context on the card, not on discovering what to read.

One handoff per card, named `VI-<card>.md` (`VI-A1.md`, `VI-A2.md`, …), written from
[`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md). Each card writes **exactly one**; corrections are appended as
dated amendments and never rewritten. No card edits another card's handoff, and no card
edits the Part VI board in `TODO.md` — the wave integrator updates the board after
independent verification.

The board is `TODO.md` → **Part VI**, §VI.0–§VI.6. The decision of record is
`docs/adr/0061-provider-credentials-at-the-runner-boundary.md`, written by VI-A2 and
accepted by the user before Wave 15 opens. The story every doc reuses is §VI.0's statement.

## Waves, order, and the base to branch from

| Wave | Cards | Parallel? | Needs | Base SHA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | VI-A1 · VI-A2 · VI-A3 | all three | nothing | `c6407dc` — dispatched 2026-09-03 |
| 15 | VI-B1 → VI-B2 → VI-B3 | **no** — sequential | ADR 0061 accepted (2026-09-03, `VI-A2.md` amendments) | `02aa4e3` — **B1 dispatched 2026-09-03**; — the 2026-09-03 planning commit; branch from the `develop` tip. Decision 1 refined 2026-09-03 (keychain first, file fallback) — B1's block below already matches |
| 16 | VI-C3 · VI-C4 first; then VI-C1; then VI-C2 | C3 ∥ C4 (may start during Wave 15); C1 after B2+B3; C2 after C3 | see each block | **C3 and C4 dispatched 2026-09-03 from `02aa4e3`**; C1 and C2 branch from the Wave 15 integration SHA |
| 17 | VI-D2 → VI-D1 | no | D2: C1, C2 and Part V's V-C2 landed; D1: everything | Wave 16 integration SHA |

**Integration line: `develop`.** Every card branches from it as `agent/vi-<card>-<slug>`
(`agent/vi-a1-docs-path`, `agent/vi-b2-vercel-gateway`, …) and never merges itself.

## Before dispatching a wave — the dispatcher's checklist

1. `git status --porcelain` on `develop` is empty and the planning edits (board, roadmap,
   skills, this directory) are committed. Cards branch from a clean line, never from a
   working tree with someone else's edits in it.
2. Record the base SHA in the table above and in the Part VI status table. **Pin the actual
   tip — `git rev-parse --short develop` — not the SHA of the planning commit.** On
   2026-09-03 the prompts named `02aa4e3` while `develop` was already at `85f2bfa`; every
   agent branched from `02aa4e3` and ended up two docs-only commits behind. Harmless that
   time, a conflict the next time the gap contains code.
3. For Wave 15 only: the user has accepted ADR 0061 (the acceptance is dated in
   `VI-A2.md`). Without it, B1–B3 encode a guess. **Done 2026-09-03.**
5. Part VII (`docs/agent-handoffs/part-vii/README.md`) runs alongside this Part. VI-B1 and
   VII-A2 both add an arm to `crates/tack-cli/src/main.rs`: merge sequentially, build once
   with both. VII-B2 reads VI-B3's `GET /api/local-runner` when it exists; VII-C2 waits for
   VI-C1 and for VI-D2 on `README.md`.
4. Reap finished worktree targets — parallel builds fill `/home`
   (`du -sh /var/tmp/tack-agent-targets/*`).

## How to dispatch a card to a Sonnet agent

One `Agent` call per card, `model: "sonnet"`, `isolation: "worktree"`,
`run_in_background: true` for every card in a parallel set. The prompt is the generic one
below with the id substituted; the block-specific line is added where the card's block says
so. The dispatcher — Opus, acting as integrator — does **not** read the cards' handoffs
whole afterwards; it runs the escalation grep in `/integrate` §3 and this file's per-wave
checklist.

```text
You are working card VI-<ID> of Tack's Part VI board. Run /card VI-<ID>.
Before reading anything else, read the header and the VI-<ID> block of
docs/agent-handoffs/part-vi/README.md and follow its read list exactly — it is
sized for your context. Read nothing it does not name without recording why in
your handoff. Do not read TODO.md whole, any harness adapter file whole,
docs/openapi.json, or any handoff the block does not name. Do not spawn
subagents. Deliver the card's Acceptance list, run the gate the block names,
write docs/agent-handoffs/part-vi/VI-<ID>.md from TEMPLATE.md, and finish with
the report shape in .claude/reporting-contract.md. Do not commit. If your
context passes ~150k tokens, stop, write the handoff with what you have, and say
so in "Context spent".
```

**Context rules for every card** (they are in the prompt because Sonnet will not infer them):

- **Cold start ≤ 25k tokens** before the first edit, **≤ 120k** at handoff. The numbers in
  each block are measured (`wc -l` × ~16 tokens/line for `TODO.md`, ~12 for code and docs);
  re-measure only if you are about to exceed them.
- `TODO.md` is read by anchor, never by line number and never whole:

  ```bash
  head -58 TODO.md                                             # header, ~1k
  a=$(grep -n "^## §VI.0" TODO.md|cut -d: -f1); b=$(grep -n "^## §VI.4" TODO.md|cut -d: -f1)
  sed -n "${a},$((b-1))p" TODO.md                              # capsule + rules + ownership + graph, ~5k
  n=$(grep -n "### VI-<ID> " TODO.md|cut -d: -f1); sed -n "${n},$((n+75))p" TODO.md   # your card, ~1k
  ```

  That is the whole board any card needs: ~7k tokens. `CLAUDE.md` is already in your
  context; `.claude/scope-discipline.md` is ~2.5k and is worth it once.
- **The four traps in this Part, by size:** `crates/tack-runner/src/harness/{codex,claude_code,opencode}.rs`
  are 1,761 / 2,300 / 2,521 lines (~80k tokens together) — read the ranges the block
  names, never a whole file. `docs/openapi.json` is ~88k — query it with `python3 -c`.
  `TODO.md` whole is ~199k. All handoffs together are ~240k — a block names at most two.
- **A file you opened and did not use is a finding.** List it under "Context spent" in
  the handoff; the integrator uses that to fix this file for the next agent.
- **No subagents from a card.** A subagent costs a full context; every block below is
  sized so one agent can do the card alone.
- Every gate command sets `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/var/tmp/tack-agent-targets/VI-<ID>` — the
  shared target has filled `/home` before.

---

## Wave 14 — Truth first

### VI-A1 — Write the path from a board item to a completed attempt, and delete what is false

**Branch:** `agent/vi-a1-docs-path`. **Owns:** see the card. Pure docs; no crate.

**Read (≈ 22k):**
- The board prelude above (~7k).
- `docs/book/src/user-guide/agent-runners.md` whole (433 l, ~6k) — you are restructuring it.
- `docs/book/src/user-guide/cli.md` whole (238 l, ~3k); `configuration.md` whole (96 l);
  `quick-start.md` whole (122 l).
- `docs/CONFIG.md` whole (151 l, ~2k); `docs/API-REFERENCE.md` `sed -n '1265,1295p'`;
  `docs/MCP.md` `sed -n '95,102p'`.
- The precedence, from its source: `sed -n '1,45p' crates/tack-orch/src/model_policy/wiring.rs`
  and `sed -n '1,30p' crates/tack-orch/src/model_policy/mod.rs` (~1k).
- The CLI's own help, **run, not read**: `cargo run -q -p tack-cli -- execution create --help`
  and the same for `runner`, `fleet`, `agent-profile`, `model-profile`. Never open
  `crates/tack-cli/src/main.rs`.
- The request's required fields: `python3 -c "import json;d=json.load(open('docs/openapi.json'));print(d['components']['schemas']['CreateExecution']['required'])"`.

**Do not read:** any handoff; any adapter; `docs/openapi.json` whole; the roadmap.

**Gate:** `/gate docs` — `mdbook build docs/book` clean, `grep -rn claude_code docs/book/`
empty, and every example in your pages **executed** against a live
`tack serve --with-runner` with its output pasted (the fake-harness shim in
`scripts/smoke.sh` is fine for the attempt itself).

**Handoff extras:** claim → evidence (every example → its transcript); surface-map delta
(none expected — say so); vocabulary check is not required for this card.

**Stop if:** an example cannot be made to run against the current product. Record the
exact failure — that is a finding for VI-D1 or a runtime card, not something to paper over
with a constructed transcript.

### VI-A2 — ADR 0061: provider credentials and model catalogs at the runner boundary

**Branch:** `agent/vi-a2-adr-0061`. **Owns:** the ADR, one bullet of `docs/CONFIG.md`.
No code. **Prepares and stops** — the user accepts the ADR.

**Read (≈ 12k):**
- The board prelude (~7k) — the surface map and the statement are this card's inputs.
- `docs/adr/0050-runner-control-plane.md` whole (99 l); `docs/adr/0058-standalone-single-binary-runner.md`
  whole (103 l); `head -40 docs/adr/0060-docket-control-plane-disposition.md` for the house
  format (~3k together).
- `docs/CONFIG.md` `sed -n '85,110p'` — the bullet you replace.
- What exists on the runner side, by range: `sed -n '1,45p' crates/tack-orch/src/model_policy/wiring.rs`;
  `sed -n '55,70p;925,945p' crates/tack-runner/src/harness/claude_code.rs`;
  `sed -n '765,780p' crates/tack-runner/src/harness/codex.rs`;
  `rg -n "state_dir|RunnerCredential|REDACTED" crates/tack-runner/src/config.rs`;
  `rg -n "with_runner_enabled|loopback|fn " crates/tack-cli/src/local_runner.rs | head -30`;
  `rg -n "app_meta|secret" crates/tack-api/src/handlers/settings.rs | head -15` (the one
  precedent for a UI-written secret, which the ADR must distinguish itself from).
- `grep -n -i "credential\|proxy\|invisible" docs/agent-handoffs/part-iv/IV-A5.md | head`
  — the earlier card that saw the confusion and fixed only the visibility.

**Do not read:** any adapter beyond the ranges above; the frontend; other handoffs.

**Gate:** none to run. The deliverable is reviewed, not tested: every decision names its
rejected options and their cost; 0050 and 0058 are cited by line for what is reaffirmed
and what is bounded; the `docs/CONFIG.md` sentence is replaced; the handoff lists every
sentence in `docs/` and `README.md` the ADR makes imprecise
(`grep -rn "never becomes a model proxy\|no TACK_\* variable for a model provider\|never reads, stores, or forwards" docs/ README.md`).

**Handoff extras:** the six decisions as a table (decision · chosen · rejected · cost);
the user's acceptance line is added by the dispatcher as an amendment with the date.

**Stop if:** a decision needs a fact you cannot measure from the ranges above (for
example whether `local_runner.rs` can start the runner after `serve` is up). State the
question with the smallest experiment that answers it; do not run the experiment.

### VI-A3 — Two components, one product: the README, the introduction and the diagram

**Branch:** `agent/vi-a3-two-components`. **Owns:** `README.md`, `introduction.md`, the
developer overview's opening, `docs/diagrams/**`, one sentence of `CLAUDE.md`. Prepares the
GitHub description; applies nothing outward-facing.

**Read (≈ 11k):**
- The board prelude (~7k) — the statement is applied verbatim; copy it from §VI.0, do
  not retype it.
- `README.md` whole (263 l, ~3.5k); `docs/book/src/introduction.md` whole (60 l);
  `head -40 docs/book/src/developer/README.md`.
- `grep -n -i "claim\|evidence" docs/agent-handoffs/part-v/V-A4.md | head -20`, then only
  the claim → evidence table's range — every claim you keep must keep its proof.
- The recovery-demo slot's source: `n=$(grep -n "### V-C2 " TODO.md|cut -d: -f1); sed -n "${n},$((n+26))p" TODO.md`.
- `ls docs/screenshots/`; `cat docs/book/book.toml` (whether the book has a mermaid
  preprocessor — decides SVG vs mermaid).

**Do not read:** `CLAUDE.md` again (it is in your context; you change one sentence);
the rest of `developer/README.md`; any crate; other handoffs.

**Gate:** `/gate docs` — `mdbook build docs/book` clean. Render proof: three PNGs of the
diagram (GitHub light, GitHub dark, the built book) — use `npx playwright screenshot` or
the `frontend/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts` pattern; attach paths in the handoff. The
stranger-read test: the dispatcher runs it (below); you state which line range constitutes
"the first screen".

**Handoff extras:** `diff` proving the statement is byte-identical across the four places;
vocabulary check (the README may say "runner" — it is telling the story); the drafted
GitHub description; claim → evidence for every first-screen claim.

**Dispatcher's adversarial check:** a fresh Sonnet agent, given **only** the README's first
screen (the line range the handoff names), is asked what the product is. It must answer:
two parts, what each holds, one board / many runners. If it answers "a project manager",
the card is not done.

**Stop if:** a claim on the first screen has no proof in V-A2/V-A3/V-A4's handoffs or the
smoke. Delete the claim; do not soften it.

---

## Wave 15 — Provider at the runner boundary (sequential: B1 → B2 → B3)

### VI-B1 — A runner-local secret store, and `secret_reference` finally resolves

**Branch:** `agent/vi-b1-secret-store` from the Wave 14 integration SHA.

**Read (≈ 19k):**
- The board prelude (~7k) and `docs/adr/0061-*.md` (~2k, decisions 1 and 4 — decision 1
  is keychain-first; the card's Design paragraph is the authority on the two backends).
- The `keyring` crate, 4.x: the platform stores are separate crates
  (`apple-native-keyring-store`, `windows-native-keyring-store`,
  `dbus-secret-service-keyring-store` or `zbus-secret-service-keyring-store`,
  `linux-keyutils-keyring-store`). Confirm names and feature flags with `cargo info keyring`
  and `cargo doc -p keyring` after adding it — do not assume from memory, do not fetch the web.
- The contract's shape: `grep -n -B2 -A6 secret_reference docs/contracts/runner-v1/claim.response.json`;
  `rg -n "struct EnvironmentValue" -A 12 crates/tack-orch/src/execution/types.rs`.
- Each adapter's environment builder, **by range only**:
  `sed -n '920,975p' crates/tack-runner/src/harness/claude_code.rs`;
  `sed -n '740,790p' crates/tack-runner/src/harness/codex.rs`;
  `sed -n '1125,1170p' crates/tack-runner/src/harness/opencode.rs` (~2k together).
- Where validation happens before spawn: `rg -n "fn validate|trait HarnessAdapter|trait HarnessProbe" -A 8 crates/tack-runner/src/harness/mod.rs | head -60`.
- `crates/tack-runner/src/config.rs` whole (208 l, ~2.5k) — the state-dir handling and the
  `RunnerCredential` redaction you copy exactly.
- The CLI arm you extend: `n=$(grep -n "Commands::Runner" crates/tack-cli/src/main.rs|cut -d: -f1); sed -n "${n},$((n+40))p" crates/tack-cli/src/main.rs`;
  `head -60 crates/tack-cli/src/doctor.rs` as the small-module precedent.
- The fake-harness shim you prove with: `rg -n "shim|fake" scripts/smoke.sh | head -12` and
  `sed -n '850,885p' crates/tack-runner/src/harness/mod.rs`.

**Do not read:** any adapter whole (the ranges above are the only parts that change);
`bootstrap.rs`; the frontend; `docs/openapi.json`.

**Gate:** `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/var/tmp/tack-agent-targets/VI-B1 cargo test -p tack-runner`
and `-p tack-orch --test runner_contract` (must be byte-identical — you changed no
fixture), then `/gate runner`. The reverted-fix proof: remove the resolver once, watch the
"variable is set" assertion fail, restore, record both runs. The keychain proof is live
and manual: `secret-tool lookup service tack-runner account <name>` (Linux) or
`security find-generic-password -s tack-runner -a <name>` (macOS) — record the command and
exit status, never the output. The fallback proof: run with the platform store unreachable
(`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=/dev/null` on Linux) and assert `tack runner doctor` reports
`backend: file`. Unit tests use the file backend (and `keyring`'s in-crate mock if 4.x has
one — check, don't assume) so CI needs no Secret Service.

**Handoff extras:** secret-path proof (the `stat -c '%a'`, the log capture with the name
present and the value absent, the keychain and fallback commands with exit statuses);
which backend the dev machine ended up on; surface-map delta (none — say so).

**Stop if:** resolution cannot happen at `validate` without touching the journal
ordering. State the ordering constraint you found; do not move the journal write. Also
stop if no platform store can be reached on this machine at all: prove the file backend
fully, record the failure, and leave the keychain proof to the integrator — never fake it.

### VI-B2 — Vercel AI Gateway as a runner provider

**Branch:** `agent/vi-b2-vercel-gateway` from B1's merge. **The heaviest card here.**

**Read (≈ 30k):**
- The board prelude (~7k); `VI-B1.md` (how the store is read, ~3k); the ADR (~2k).
- **Vendor facts, re-fetched, not trusted from the card:** `WebFetch` the three pages
  with a narrow prompt each (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode under
  `vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/coding-agents/`), ~2k each. Never `curl` a whole page into
  context.
- Each adapter, three ranges each and nothing more — module doc, probe, spawn/args:
  `sed -n '1,90p;680,800p' crates/tack-runner/src/harness/codex.rs`;
  `sed -n '1,90p;800,1000p' crates/tack-runner/src/harness/claude_code.rs`;
  `sed -n '1,90p;1000,1180p' crates/tack-runner/src/harness/opencode.rs` (~9k together).
- `rg -n "pub async fn probe|DiscoveryReport|fn build_adapter_registry" -A 15 crates/tack-runner/src/bootstrap.rs | head -80`.
- `sed -n '40,110p' crates/tack-orch/src/execution/capabilities.rs` (`model_combinations`,
  `model_passthrough`, `additional`).
- `rg -n "model_combinations|model_passthrough|ModelSelector" crates/tack-orch/src/scheduler/select.rs | head -20`,
  then the one function that intersects — you do not change it; you must know what it
  reads.
- `crates/tack-cli/src/doctor.rs` whole (463 l, ~5k) — it gains a provider block.
- `docs/CONFIG.md` `sed -n '85,110p'` — the rows you add sit here.

**Do not read:** any adapter outside the ranges; `select.rs` whole (705 l); `mod.rs` of
harness (1,171 l) beyond a grep; the frontend; other handoffs.

**Gate:** `cargo test -p tack-runner`, `-p tack-orch` (`runner_contract` byte-identical or
an escalation naming the missing field), `-p tack-api --test wave2_gate`; then
`/gate runner`. **Live proof is billed** — run the real `claude-code` attempt once,
deliberately, and record the request id; the second harness likewise.

**Handoff extras:** secret-path proof (the `sqlite3 tack.db .dump | grep -c` with its
positive control); the measured vendor table (what each harness actually accepted — this
replaces the card's table for VI-C1 and VI-D1); the actual-model observation per harness
with its `model_observation_source`; surface-map delta (the provider row — reached for
which harnesses).

**Stop if:** a harness cannot receive the key non-interactively (OpenCode is the likely
one). Record it as a measured fact with the command that proved it, mark that harness's
gateway path as a console step, and continue with the others — do not write to a user's
`~/.codex/config.toml` or `auth.json` to get past it.

### VI-B3 — The embedded runner, controlled from the UI: turn it on, hand it a key

**Branch:** `agent/vi-b3-embedded-control` from B2's merge.

**Read (≈ 20k):**
- The board prelude (~7k); `VI-B1.md` (~3k); the ADR — decisions 2 and 6 (~2k).
- `crates/tack-cli/src/local_runner.rs` whole (451 l, ~5.5k) — the file you restructure.
- `rg -n "pub async fn serve" -A 20 crates/tack-api/src/lib.rs`; `rg -n "pub struct AppState" -A 30 crates/tack-api/src/*.rs | head -50`.
- The gated-mount pattern you copy: `sed -n '60,140p' crates/tack-api/src/router.rs` and
  `rg -n "require_orch_enabled|orch_routes" crates/tack-api/src/router.rs`.
- The write-only-secret and `app_meta` precedents: `rg -n "app_meta|secret_key|pub async fn" crates/tack-api/src/handlers/settings.rs | head -30`.
- Frontend precedents: `frontend/src/features/fleet/runnerFleet/ModelProfilesPanel.tsx`
  whole (167 l, ~2k) for a panel; `head -60 frontend/src/shared/execution/api.ts` for the
  client shape; `rg -ln "backup" frontend/src/features/settings | head -3` then the
  secret-field component only.
- How E2E starts a server: `head -60 frontend/e2e/helpers.ts`; `head -40 frontend/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`.

**Do not read:** `router.rs` whole (528 l) beyond the ranges; any adapter; `bootstrap.rs`
beyond a grep for the re-probe entry point.

**Gate:** `cargo test -p tack-api` (includes `openapi_contract` — **regenerate**, do not
hand-edit: `UPDATE_OPENAPI=1 cargo test -p tack-api --test openapi_contract` then
`cd frontend && npm run gen:api`), `cargo test -p tack-cli`, `/gate api`, `/gate frontend`,
and the two Playwright specs you add (`make e2e` scoped with `-g`).

**Handoff extras:** secret-path proof (`app_meta` row count before/after; the dump grep;
the `stat`); the non-loopback 404 proof (the test name); the persisted-flag round trip
(restart without the flag → runner returns).

**Stop if:** the runner cannot be started after `serve` is up without a second code path
into the runtime. Escalate with the exact seam; do not call runner handlers directly (the
Part IV mistake this directory's sibling README warns about applies here unchanged).

---

## Wave 16 — UI-first flow

### VI-C3 — Project-level agent settings (start early; may branch from the Wave 14 SHA)

**Branch:** `agent/vi-c3-project-agent-settings`.

**Read (≈ 28k):**
- The board prelude (~7k); the ADR's vocabulary decision (~1k).
- The migration list and the last migration's shape: `sed -n '95,135p' crates/tack-db/src/migrations.rs`;
  `n=$(grep -n "MIGRATION_061" crates/tack-db/src/migrations.rs|head -1|cut -d: -f1); sed -n "${n},$((n+25))p" crates/tack-db/src/migrations.rs`.
  **One `ALTER`, one migration name, number 062.**
- `rg -n "pub struct Project\b" -A 30 crates/tack-core/src/models.rs`;
  `rg -n "pub async fn|vocabulary|workflow" crates/tack-db/src/repo/projects.rs | head -30`;
  `rg -n "UpdateProject|pub async fn update" -A 25 crates/tack-api/src/handlers/projects.rs | head -80`;
  `rg -n "UpdateProject" crates/ --type rust -l` — every constructor must gain the field.
- `crates/tack-orch/src/model_policy/wiring.rs` whole (207 l, ~2.5k) — you replace the
  always-`None` tier; `rg -n "^async fn|^fn|#\[tokio::test\]" -A1 crates/tack-orch/tests/model_policy_test.rs | head -40`
  then one test body as the pattern.
- `frontend/src/features/settings/ProjectSettings.tsx` whole (165 l) and one existing tab
  (`rg -ln "general" frontend/src/features/settings | head -2`);
  `AgentProfilesPanel.tsx` whole (170 l); `FleetsPanel.tsx` whole (173 l);
  `rg -n "fleet|member" frontend/src/shared/execution/api.ts | head -20`.

**Do not read:** `migrations.rs` whole (1,614 l); `select.rs`; any adapter; `RunWithAgentModal.tsx`
(C2's).

**Gate:** `cargo test -p tack-db` (fresh DB **and** an upgraded copy of a beta.7 `tack.db` —
say where you got it), `-p tack-orch` (the new project-tier test), `-p tack-api`
(regenerate `openapi.json`/`schema.gen.ts`), `/gate frontend`, the settings E2E. The
fleet-member proof goes through the route, not the database.

**Handoff extras:** surface-map delta (the "choose a default model" and "add a member"
rows); the migration's `run_all` transcripts; the list of `UpdateProject` constructors
touched.

**Stop if:** the JSON blob cannot be validated against a typed struct at write time
without a second validation path at read time. State it; do not tolerate a malformed
blob at read.

### VI-C4 — List what an attempt produced (independent; may branch from the Wave 14 SHA)

**Branch:** `agent/vi-c4-attempt-lists`.

**Read (≈ 18k):**
- The board prelude (~7k).
- The concrete request from the card that found the gap: `sed -n '335,375p' docs/agent-handoffs/part-iii/III-F4.md`
  (~0.7k). Do not read the rest of that 472-line file.
- `rg -ln "execution_artifacts|execution_decisions" crates/tack-api/src/handlers crates/tack-db/src/repo`,
  then `rg -n "pub async fn" <those files> | head -40`; `rg -n "/executions" crates/tack-api/src/router.rs`.
- `frontend/src/shared/runWithAgent/DecisionInbox.tsx` whole (337 l, ~4k);
  `ArtifactDownloadPanel.tsx` whole (124 l); `frontend/src/features/item-detail/tabs/AgentActivityTab.tsx`
  whole (225 l, ~2.7k); `rg -n "artifact|decision" frontend/src/shared/execution/api.ts`.
- `frontend/e2e/execution-attempt-detail.spec.ts` whole — you extend it.

**Do not read:** runner-protocol handlers (`handlers/runner_protocol*.rs` — you add
operator routes only); any adapter; the modal.

**Gate:** `cargo test -p tack-api` (regenerate the spec), `--test runner_contract`
byte-identical, `/gate frontend`, the extended E2E with its byte-equality download proof
intact.

**Handoff extras:** surface-map delta (the last row); the route shapes as shipped versus
III-F4's request, with any difference justified.

### VI-C1 — The Agents page (after B2 and B3)

**Branch:** `agent/vi-c1-agents-page`.

**Read (≈ 18k):**
- The board prelude (~7k); `VI-B3.md` (the routes and panels you compose, ~3k);
  from `VI-B2.md` only its measured vendor table (`grep -n -A 12 -i "measured vendor" docs/agent-handoffs/part-vi/VI-B2.md`).
- `sed -n '1,130p;225,260p' frontend/src/shared/runWithAgent/shared.ts` (capability
  helpers and the gate — reuse, do not fork);
  `rg -n "RunnerCapabilities|HarnessCapability|interface RunnerSummary" -A 15 frontend/src/shared/execution/types.ts | head -70`.
- `frontend/src/features/fleet/runnerFleet/RunnerFleetSection.tsx` whole (51 l);
  `rg -n "RunnerFleetSection" frontend/src/features/fleet/FleetPage.tsx` — the one line you
  move; `head -40` of `EnrollmentPanel.tsx` and `RunnerHealthCard.tsx` (props only).
- `frontend/src/app/routes.tsx` whole (55 l); `rg -n -i "fleet" -B2 -A6 frontend/src/shared/ui/Sidebar.tsx`.
- `rg -n "RunWithAgentButton|capabilities" frontend/src/features/board/Board.tsx | head`
  — where the first-run banner mounts.
- `head -60 frontend/e2e/run-with-agent.spec.ts`; `head -60 frontend/e2e/helpers.ts`.
- The command strings the page must match: `sed -n '85,110p' docs/CONFIG.md`.

**Do not read:** `FleetPage.tsx` beyond the grep (the rest is docket); `RunWithAgentModal.tsx`
(C2's); any crate.

**Gate:** `/gate frontend` + the Playwright journeys the card names (`make e2e` scoped).
The vocabulary test is proven load-bearing by putting "runner" on the default screen once.

**Handoff extras:** vocabulary check (the grep, its hits, and why each is under
*Advanced*); surface-map delta (every row the page renders, reached or not); the exported
constant's path for VI-D1.

**Stop if:** a status cannot be derived from an API observation. Render "unknown" with the
reason — never a check mark from a file's existence, never a hard-coded string.

### VI-C2 — Run with agent: zero hand-typed identifiers (after C3)

**Branch:** `agent/vi-c2-modal-defaults`.

**Read (≈ 20k):**
- The board prelude (~7k); `VI-C3.md` (the settings shape and its client, ~3k).
- `frontend/src/shared/runWithAgent/RunWithAgentModal.tsx` whole (470 l, ~5.5k) and
  `shared.ts` whole (334 l, ~4k) — you rework the first and must not change the gate
  helper in the second; `head -80 RunWithAgentModal.test.tsx`.
- `rg -n "export const|fleets|runners|agentProfiles" frontend/src/shared/execution/api.ts | head -30`;
  `rg -n "export" frontend/src/shared/execution/store.ts | head` (the chip's source).
- `rg -n "RunWithAgentButton" -B5 -A10 frontend/src/features/board/Board.tsx` — the chip's
  placement.
- `head -120 frontend/e2e/run-with-agent.spec.ts`.

**Do not read:** any crate; the Agents page (C1's); other handoffs.

**Gate:** `/gate frontend`, then the E2E that intercepts `POST /api/executions` and asserts
the body equals the project defaults field for field. `shared.ts`'s gate helper must be
byte-identical (`git diff` it in the handoff).

**Handoff extras:** vocabulary check; surface-map delta (the "run an item" row); whether
`base_revision` accepts a ref — measured against the runner's checkout, with the command.

## Wave 17 — Proof

### VI-D2 — Assets that show the execution plane (after C1, C2 and Part V's V-C2)

**Branch:** `agent/vi-d2-assets`.

**Read (≈ 8k):**
- The board prelude's statement and surface map only (`§VI.0`, ~2.5k) plus your card.
- `docs/agent-handoffs/part-v/V-C2.md` — the recording tooling section only (grep for
  "record" and read that range); `frontend/e2e/hero-gif.spec.ts` and `screenshots.spec.ts`
  whole (the existing recording harness).
- `grep -n "screenshots/\|diagrams/" README.md` — the markup you replace.
- The *Next step* lines of `VI-C1.md` and `VI-C2.md`.

**Do not read:** anything else. This card records; it does not investigate.

**Gate:** none in code. Every asset from a release build (`cargo build --release` once, in
your own target dir — it is slow), a real agent, a machine named in the handoff; frame
count and file size measured; the request id of the completed run recorded.

**Handoff extras:** vocabulary check on alt texts; the measured sizes; V-C2's slot
untouched (`git diff` shows no change to its lines).

### VI-D1 — Prove the stranger's path, and make the docs match what shipped (last)

**Branch:** `agent/vi-d1-stranger-proof`.

**Read (≈ 22k):**
- The board prelude (~7k) — §VI.5's table is your checklist.
- From every `VI-*.md` in this directory, **only three sections**, extracted, not read:

  ```bash
  for f in docs/agent-handoffs/part-vi/VI-*.md; do echo "== $f"; \
    awk '/^## (What a stranger|Surface-map delta|Next step)/{p=1;print;next} /^## /{p=0} p' "$f"; done
  ```
- `scripts/smoke.sh` whole (538 l, ~7k) — you add steps 13–14 in its own idiom.
- `docs/book/src/user-guide/quick-start.md` whole; the two sections VI-A1 added to
  `agent-runners.md` (grep their headings, read those ranges); the README's "Run it"
  section (`grep -n "^## Run it" README.md`, then that range).
- `docs/CONFIG.md` whole (~2k).

**Do not read:** any handoff whole; any crate; the frontend beyond the exported constant
VI-C1 named.

**Gate:** `./scripts/smoke.sh` green with steps 13–14 proven by injected failure;
`/gate docs`; `/gate full` once, as the integrator will run it. The stranger transcript is
produced on a clean container with the release binary.

**Handoff extras:** the surface map with every Target marked reached / not reached and
why; the re-measured §VI.0 evidence table; the stranger transcript; vocabulary check on
the docs you amended.

## Integrator checklist, per wave

The integrator is the dispatcher (Opus). It reads escalations, not handoffs — `/integrate`
§3's grep — plus the checks below, which are the adversarial verification §III.2 rule 14
requires. Merge order is the dependency order in the table at the top.

**Wave 14.** Run VI-A1's `tack execution create` example yourself against a fresh
`tack serve --with-runner`; `grep -rn claude_code docs/book/` is empty; `mdbook build` is
clean. VI-A2: record the user's acceptance as a dated amendment in `VI-A2.md`; confirm the
`docs/CONFIG.md` sentence is gone. VI-A3: run the stranger-read test with a fresh Sonnet
given only the named line range; `diff` the statement across the four files; open the
three render PNGs. Update the status row with the integration SHA. Nothing to regenerate.

**Wave 15.** Merge B1, build `tack-runner`; merge B2, build; merge B3, regenerate
`openapi.json` and `schema.gen.ts`, commit them with the merge. Gate:
`cargo test -p tack-runner -p tack-orch -p tack-api -p tack-cli`, `runner_contract`
byte-identical (or the accepted revision, with its pin-table update), `wave2_gate`, then
`./scripts/smoke.sh` (existing steps must stay green). Adversarial: revert B1's resolver →
its test fails; after a gateway run, `sqlite3 tack.db .dump | grep -c <key>` = 0 and the
store file is `600`; start on `0.0.0.0` → every `local-runner` route is 404; restart
without the flag → the runner comes back. Record the live request ids B2 produced.

**Wave 16.** Merge C3, regenerate; merge C4, regenerate; merge C1; merge C2. Gate: the
Rust crates C3/C4 touched, `runner_contract` byte-identical, `/gate frontend`, `make e2e`.
Adversarial: put "runner" on the Agents default screen → C1's test fails; submit the modal
untouched → the intercepted body equals the project defaults; migration 062 on an
upgraded beta.7 database copy; `shared.ts`'s gate helper unchanged (`git diff`).

**Wave 17.** D2 after V-C2 has landed — check `git log -- docs/screenshots/`. D1 last.
Reproduce the stranger transcript yourself on a clean container; run smoke with the
injected failure for steps 13–14; walk §VI.5's table row by row and mark each; if a row
does not hold, name the single card that would close it rather than closing the Part.
Then the `/integrate` §7 close-out.

## The mistakes this Part is most likely to make

1. **Putting a provider key anywhere but the runner's store** — `app_meta` because backup
   secrets live there, a request's `environment` value because it is convenient, a log line
   because the name and the value were formatted together. Every card that touches a
   secret proves the *absence* with a positive control.
2. **A green status derived from a file existing.** A session file is "present,
   unverified". Only a completed run or a successful catalog call earns a check mark.
3. **Architecture words on a default screen.** "Runner" in a modal label, "fleet" in a
   dropdown, "harness" in a heading. C1's grep test exists because reviewers miss these.
4. **Splitting a feature into a mechanism card and a caller card.** C3 is wide on purpose.
   A column with no reader, a route with no panel, a store with no resolver — the
   scope-discipline failure this tree keeps repeating.
5. **Reading an adapter whole.** Three files, ~80k tokens, and the card needed sixty lines
   of one of them. The read lists above name the ranges; trust them, and record it if one
   is wrong.
6. **A README claim without a proof.** V-A4's claim → evidence rule did not end with Part V.
   A3 and D1 keep the table; a row without evidence is a claim to delete.
7. **A smoke step that cannot fail.** Steps 13–14 must be proven by breaking the feature
   once and watching `FAIL` — this repository has shipped a false green before.
