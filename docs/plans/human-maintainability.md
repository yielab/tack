# Human maintainability: tests, comments and documentation

**Status: accepted into the roadmap 2026-09-11 as Part IX (Phase 63), the priority board.
Waves 27–31 (M0–M7) landed by 2026-09-12; a re-audit that day found the test-volume target
untouched and re-cut the last two cards into M8 and M9 (§6, decision 5).** First measured
2026-09-11 on `develop` at `f95fbc2`; the §1 table carries a 2026-09-12 column. Every
number comes from `scripts/maintainability.py` (this plan's tool) or from the one-line
commands in [Appendix A](#appendix-a--commands-behind-the-numbers); re-run them before
quoting — this plan's own §5 estimate for M4 was off by an order of magnitude, and the
board carried it for a wave before anyone re-ran the command. This plan is workspace-wide; the harness adapters have their own,
narrower audit in [`harness-maintainability-audit.md`](harness-maintainability-audit.md),
and its card T0 is referenced here rather than repeated.

**Decide:** approve (1) one place for each kind of test and a size budget per file and per
test, enforced by a ratchet so nothing gets bigger while the tree is brought under budget;
(2) the same budgets for comments, with prose that is about the vendor or the design moved
out of source files; (3) one source per documentation topic, with the book including the
authoritative files instead of copying them, the API reference generated from the spec,
and closed cycles archived out of the working tree; (4) an agent lane — scratch tests that
never enter the tree, a per-card budget checked by a script — so agents keep proving their
work without growing the corpus; and (5) an order of execution where every mechanical step
is one command and every judgment step is scoped to one file list, so no model reads a
file it will not change.

**Why now:** the code is fine; what surrounds it is not. Production Rust is 57k lines with
a 23 % comment share. Tests are 74k lines (1.29 : 1), 21k of them inside production files
so that the three largest "source" files are 70–90 % test. Non-generated docs are 91k
lines, 60k of which are agent handoffs. The whole suite runs in 18.8 s, so nothing here is
about speed; it is about how much a person must read before touching anything, at a tree
that grows 10k lines per active day.

**If you do nothing:** every card keeps adding 30-line tests with 90-character names in
four layers, every module keeps a 100-line preamble, and the corpus doubles again by the
next Part.

## 1. Where things are, and where they should be

| Measure | 2026-09-11 | After the mechanical steps (M1–M2), as planned | **Measured 2026-09-12, after M0–M7** | Target (M8/M9) | Command |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Production lines (Rust, no inline tests) | 57 453 | 57 453 | 55 448 (44 455 code) | — | `measure --totals` |
| Test lines / production lines | 74 014 / **1.29** | 74 014 / 1.29 (moved, not cut) | **71 211 / 1.284** | **≤ 0.8** — or M8's measured landing, named | `measure --totals` |
| Test lines inside `src/*.rs` | 20 882 in 40 modules over budget | **0 over budget** | 0 in the workspace; 482 in `tack-desktop/src/supervisor.rs` | 0 over 150 | `extract-tests` (dry run) |
| Unit-test lines in `src/**/tests.rs` (no M4 card owned them) | — | — | 23 070, 747 tests, 74 files | in M8 | `measure --json` |
| Tests | 1 498 (18.8 s) | 1 498 | 1 413 (16–17 s) | ≈ 1 000 | `nextest run --workspace` |
| Test bodies over 60 / over 40 lines; names over 60 chars; files over 1 000 lines | — | — | **135** / 353; **207**; **17** | 0 outside M8's exclusions | `measure --json` |
| Comment lines in production | 13 374 (23 %) | ≈ 12 300 (25 preambles moved) | 10 993 (**19.8 %**) | ≤ 20 %, no file > 35 % | `measure` |
| Comment blocks over budget | 149 in 104 files | 124 | **0** | 0 | `comment-worklist` |
| `docs/dev-notes/` notes | 0 | 25 | **0** (directory deleted by IX-M6-dev-notes) | 0 | `find docs/dev-notes -type f` |
| Near-identical test names across files | 72 pairs | 72 | **49** | 0 | `duplicate-tests` |
| Fixed waits in test code | 74 `sleep(` (25 ≥ 200 ms) | 74 | 38 `sleep(` (**11** ≥ 200 ms, 11.8 s) | 0 | `measure --totals`; `scripts/list-fixed-waits.py` |
| Live tests hiding in unit modules | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | `measure --json` |
| Docs `.md` in the read path (no `closed-cycles/`, no generated) | 91 089 | 91 089 | **29 878** (+ 66 302 archived) | ≈ 30 000 | Appendix A |

## 2. The test system

### 2.1 One place per kind of test

```
crates/<crate>/
  src/<module>.rs              production only; a trailing `mod tests` of ≤ 150 lines is fine
  src/<module>/tests.rs        that module's unit tests when they outgrow 150 lines
                               (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` — private access via `use super::*` unchanged)
  tests/
    common/mod.rs              the crate's shared fixtures — the ONLY place a helper lives
    <subject>.rs + <subject>/  one binary per subject (ADR 0064's grouping, unchanged)
    contract/                  byte-pinned: runner-v1 fixtures, OpenAPI drift, golden files
    live/                      anything that runs a real binary or bills — every test #[ignore]
    scratch_*.rs               gitignored; an agent's local proof; never tracked
crates/tack-test-support/      workspace crate for the layers below the API: migrated pool,
                               seeded project/item, controllable clock, fixture loading
```

Why `tests/common` stays per crate for API-level helpers rather than moving to the support
crate: a crate whose dev-dependency depends on it is built twice by Cargo. So
`tack-test-support` depends on `tack-core` and `tack-db` only; `tack-api/tests/common`
keeps `test_app*` and gains the request helpers that 12 files currently define for
themselves. Today `tests/common` exists in two crates with 180 lines between them and 25
importers; 18 files still define their own `project()`.

### 2.2 Rules for every test, human or agent

1. **One claim per test; variants are rows.** A family of `rejects_*` functions is one
   table-driven test whose cases fit on one screen.
2. **The name states the claim in ≤ 60 characters.** No articles, no narrative, no board
   vocabulary. `env_canary_is_redacted`, not
   `a_planted_canary_in_the_environment_never_survives_into_the_returned_outcome`.
3. **A body is ≤ 40 lines** (hard cap 60 until M9, outside M8's named exclusions). Setup
   that takes longer is a fixture in
   `tests/common`.
4. **Assert state, not just status** — this rule stays from `CLAUDE.md`; it is what makes
   one test worth keeping.
5. **An invariant is pinned in at most two layers:** the repository (what the database
   ends up holding) and one router-level test (what the wire says). The contract
   fixtures pin the shape, not the behaviour. Today `replay` appears in test names across
   six crate/layer combinations and `stale` across eight.
6. **A test file's preamble is ≤ 10 lines:** what it proves and how to run it. Why it
   exists is an ADR's job.
7. **Vendor output is a file with a provenance line, never a string literal.**
8. **No fixed waits.** Poll with a bound or pause time; `docs/adr/0064-fixed-waits.txt` is
   the inventory, regenerated by `scripts/list-fixed-waits.py` — never hand-edited, and
   re-run by every card that touches a wait. Found 2026-09-12: the committed file was stale
   (25 entries) and the generator did not count `<module>/tests.rs` as test code, so it
   briefly read 2 where the truth was 11 (9 of them in unit modules). M8 empties it.
9. **A live test lives under `tests/live/` and is `#[ignore]`d.** Never an early `return`
   on an environment variable inside a unit module.

### 2.3 The agent lane

Agents need to prove their work; the tree does not need to keep the proof. Three
mechanisms, all checked by a script rather than a prompt:

- **Scratch tests.** `crates/*/tests/scratch_*.rs` is gitignored. Cargo still discovers
  and runs it, so an agent writes as many throwaway tests as it wants, runs them with
  `-E 'binary(scratch_x)'`, and none of it can be committed: `check` fails on a tracked
  scratch file.
- **A per-card budget.** At most 15 new tests and 600 new test lines per card, measured
  by `scripts/maintainability.py check --changed` and written into the handoff's
  "Measured numbers". Over budget is a finding for the integrator, not a merge. *Not
  implemented as of 2026-09-12 — `check` has no such rule; M9 adds it.*
- **The ratchet.** `check` compares each changed file with
  `scripts/maintainability-baseline.json`: a file may break a budget only if it was
  already over it and is not worse. New files must meet every budget. The workspace
  test : production ratio may not grow. The baseline is re-taken only by a card that
  deliberately brought files down, never to make a red check green.

## 3. Comments

The rule in `CLAUDE.md` is right and stays; `scripts/check-comments.sh` keeps enforcing
what a comment may not be about. This plan adds how much. Budgets, checked by the same
`check`:

| Block | Budget | What belongs there |
|---|---|---|
| `//!` preamble, production file | ≤ 30 lines | what the module owns, its invariants, what breaks if you change them |
| `//!` preamble, test file | ≤ 10 lines | what it proves, how to run it |
| One `///` block | ≤ 15 lines | what the item does when the name does not say, the non-obvious choice, the hazard |
| Comment share of a production file | ≤ 35 % (target 30 %) | — |

Where the rest goes: vendor behaviour at a version → the fixture directory's README, next
to the captures that prove it; design rationale → an ADR, or the book's developer guide;
history → nowhere, `git log` has it. During the transition, `extract-module-docs` parks an
over-budget preamble verbatim in `docs/dev-notes/<crate>/<module>.md` with a one-line
pointer left behind. `docs/dev-notes/` has an expiry: by the end of the cycle each note has
become an ADR section, a fixture README or nothing. Today 25 preambles are over budget
(the largest, `adapters/docket.rs`, is 213 lines) and eight production files are more than
35 % comment.

## 4. Documentation

One source per topic, generated where it can be, archived when closed.

- **The book includes, it does not copy.** `docs/TESTING.md` (384 lines) and
  `docs/book/src/developer/testing.md` (296) are two versions of one page;
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` says itself that the book's crate tour is behind it. mdBook's
  `{{#include ../../TESTING.md}}` makes the `docs/*.md` files the only copy and the book
  their rendering. `CONFIG.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TESTING.md`, `MCP.md`,
  `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` all follow this pattern.
- **The API reference is generated.** `docs/openapi.json` is already the spec of record and
  `API-REFERENCE.md` (1 556 hand-written lines) already says so in its first paragraph.
  A ~150-line `scripts/gen-api-reference.py` renders the spec to the book's
  `developer/api-reference.md`; the file joins `.gitattributes`' generated list and
  `regen-generated.sh`. `API-REFERENCE.md` shrinks to the parts a spec cannot say:
  auth surfaces, WebSocket, examples.
- **`cargo doc` is a CI step**, `--workspace --no-deps` with
  `-D rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links`. Not `missing_docs`: that lint manufactures
  comments, the opposite of §3.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` from commits — adopted and wired 2026-09-11.** `cliff.toml` maps
  conventional commit types to Keep a Changelog sections; `make changelog` previews the
  unreleased section and `make changelog-release TAG=…` prepends it before tagging; the
  release workflow renders the same section as the GitHub release notes. Hand-written
  sections up to 0.1.0-beta.8 stay as history. Nothing left for a card.
- **Closed cycles move to `docs/closed-cycles/`** (decided 2026-09-11). `TODO.md` Parts
  I–III (10 200 of its 14 784 lines) go to `docs/closed-cycles/boards/part-<n>.md`, one
  file per Part; the handoffs of closed Parts (most of 230 files / 60k lines) go to
  `docs/closed-cycles/handoffs/part-<n>/`. A `docs/closed-cycles/README.md` says in its
  first line that nothing under it is current and that the live board is `TODO.md`. The
  directory is excluded from the book, from `context-budget.md`'s read lists and from
  `check-comments.sh`'s dead-pointer scan. Handoffs of the live Part stay in
  `docs/agent-handoffs/` and move when their Part closes.
  `TODO.md`'s "Which board is live" table gets one row per Part of ≤ 300 characters; today
  one cell is 18 906.
- **Screenshots and the roadmap** stay: they are product documentation. `roadmap.md`
  (3 601 lines) keeps only its `# Next` sections in the tree; the rest archives with the
  Parts it records.

## 5. Execution

Ordered so that every mechanical step lands before any judgment step, and every judgment
step gets a file list, not a tree. Model tokens are spent only where a decision is made.

| Card | What | Kind | Verification (scoped) | Expected delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Land the tool. Commit `scripts/maintainability.py` and a baseline (`baseline`), add `check --changed` to `pre-push` and CI, gitignore `crates/*/tests/scratch_*.rs`, add the budgets to `docs/TESTING.md` and `/gate`, `/card` and `/feature` (each prescribes commands; the memory rule is that every prescribing doc changes in the same commit). | human, 1 commit | `check` green on the untouched tree | gate exists, warns on regressions only |
| **M1** | Extract inline test modules: `extract-tests --apply` for the six workspace crates, `cargo fmt --all`, full `nextest`, `clippy --all-targets`, `check-comments.sh`. First prove it in a throwaway worktree; then run once on `develop`. Re-baseline. | mechanical, 0 model tokens | full suite (18.8 s) once | 40 modules, 20 882 lines leave `src/*.rs`; `engine.rs` goes from 4 295 lines to ≈ 1 260 |
| **M2** | Park over-budget preambles: `extract-module-docs --apply`; move vendor findings from the two adapter preambles into `fixtures/<kind>/README.md` per the harness audit. Re-baseline. | mechanical | `cargo check --workspace`, `check-comments.sh` | 25 files, ≈ 1 100 comment lines out of `src/` |
| **M3** | Test support: create `tack-test-support`; fill `tests/common` in api/orch/runner/cli; replace the 18 `project()`, 12 `request()`, 6 `runner()` and 4 `claim()` local copies. One card per crate (db, orch, api, runner, cli), each with the `grep` line from Appendix A as its file list. | agent per crate | `nextest -E 'package(<crate>)'` | −3 000 to −4 000 lines, no test removed |
| **M4** | Prune per test binary (28 binaries: api 8, orch 7, cli 6, runner 5, db 2). Input per card: its binary's `measure` rows, its `duplicate-tests` pairs, the `replay`/`stale`/`idempotent` map. Apply §2.2: rows for variants, two layers per invariant, ≤ 40-line bodies, ≤ 60-char names, ≤ 10-line preambles, waits from `0064-fixed-waits.txt` → polls. CI's existing line-coverage floors (core 85, db 70, api 70, orch 70, runner 85) are the guard against over-pruning. | agent per binary, largest first (`execution_repo.rs` 4 323 lines, `lifecycle.rs` 2 002, `crud.rs` 1 856, `chaos_recovery.rs` 1 329) | that binary, then coverage job | −25 000 lines, ≈ −400 tests. **Measured 2026-09-12: 17 handoffs for 19 of 29 binaries, the 13 with totals sum 41 704 → 40 511 (−2.9 %); 135 bodies still over 60 lines, 207 names over 60 chars; the coverage job never ran (it triggers on PRs and `main` only). The estimate was wrong by 20×, and the unit modules were never in scope.** |
| **M5** | Harness core: card T0 of `harness-maintainability-audit.md`, unchanged. Runs after M1 because it edits files M1 moves. | agent | `package(tack-runner)` + crash matrix | −2 000 lines, four lifecycle copies → one |
| **M6** | Trim comments per file: `comment-worklist --json` split into batches of ≈ 10 files by crate; an agent gets the block list and the §3 table, nothing else. Then empty `docs/dev-notes/`: each note → ADR / fixture README / deleted. | agent per batch | `cargo check --workspace` + `check-comments.sh` only (the `/gate` table already exempts comment-only changes from the suite) | comment share 23 % → ≤ 20 %; 0 blocks over budget. **Measured 2026-09-12: 19.8 %, 0 blocks — met; `docs/dev-notes/` not emptied (12 notes left, 9 never in a batch because the worklist lists only files still over budget) → M6-dev-notes.** |
| **M7** | Docs generation per §4: includes in the book, `gen-api-reference.py`, `cargo doc` in CI, the move to `docs/closed-cycles/`, `context-budget.md` rewritten to a quarter of its size because the files it warns about are gone. | human + one agent for the renderer | `mdbook build docs/book` with link check; `regen-generated.sh` idempotent | −60 000 doc lines from the tree. **Measured 2026-09-12: read-path `.md` 91k → 29 878, 66 302 lines archived under `docs/closed-cycles/` (moved out of the read path, not out of the repository); `roadmap.md` untouched → M7-roadmap; `context-budget.md` re-measured, not quartered (82 → 88 lines — it was never large).** |
| **M8** | Close the test-volume gap, added 2026-09-12: the second pass over everything M4 missed — the 74 unit-test modules (23 070 lines), the ten uncarded binaries, the 135 bodies / 207 names / 17 files still over budget, the 11 fixed waits, the 49 duplicate pairs. `M8-dedup` first, then `M8-<crate>` per crate owning both `tests/**` and `src/**/tests.rs`, largest ratio first (orch, runner, api, db, cli + the `tack-desktop` inline module). Acceptance is measured per crate with no ratchet; exclusions are named in the card, and each sub-card runs its crate's `cargo llvm-cov` floor itself because CI's coverage job never runs on `develop`. Alongside: `M6-dev-notes` and `M7-roadmap` for the two orphaned items. | agent per crate, two at a time | that crate's `nextest`, `llvm-cov` floor, `check --changed` | measured, not promised — the achieved ratio is what M9 locks |
| **M9** | Ratchet down (was M8): `check` grows the per-card budget §2.3 promised; BUDGETS set to the targets (40-line bodies, 30 % share, 1 000-line files) and `check` switched from "over budget *and* worse" to "over budget", with the exclusion list M8's handoffs named written into the script; the workspace ratio ceiling locked at M8's achieved number (0.8 is the aspiration; a named gap is an accepted outcome); re-baseline. | human, 1 commit | `check` green | the budgets become the definition of done |

Cost discipline for the agent cards (M3, M4, M6): each prompt carries the card's file
list and the relevant rule table; the agent runs `check --changed` and the one scoped
`nextest` filterset; the full suite runs once, at integration. M1 and M2 cost no tokens at
all and remove 22k lines from `src/`; running them first means every later agent reads
production files that are production files.

Not a card: the frontend. At 27.9k source lines to 13.9k unit and 4.5k E2E lines it is
inside the target ratio already; §2.2's naming and body rules apply to new tests, and
`check` can grow a `.test.tsx` scanner if it drifts.

## 6. Decisions this plan needs

1. ~~Archive location~~ — decided 2026-09-11: `docs/closed-cycles/` (§4).
2. ~~`git-cliff` for the changelog~~ — adopted and wired 2026-09-11 (§4).
3. The budget numbers in §2.2 and §3 — they are defaults with a command behind them, not
   findings; pick the ones you would hold a person to.
4. ~~Whether M4 runs before or after M5~~ — ran before, as proposed (Wave 29 before Wave 30).
5. ~~Whether the workspace ratio target is a hard 0.8 or a measured landing point~~ —
   decided 2026-09-12, after re-measuring every number in this plan before dispatching
   Wave 32 (the §1 table's new column; the full list is TODO.md's Wave 32 audit note). M4
   was integrated on its ratchet ("not worse"), cut 2.9 % where it priced 34 %, never
   owned the unit-test modules, and its coverage guard never ran; the old M8 (hard-lock at
   0.8) would have failed 96 files the moment it ran. Split into **M8** (the second pass
   over everything, per crate, no ratchet, exclusions named), **M9** (the ratchet-lock,
   which also implements the per-card budget and locks the ratio at M8's measured number,
   with any gap to 0.8 named), plus **M6-dev-notes** and **M7-roadmap** for the two items
   their parent cards dropped. Two tool defects fixed the same day:
   `scripts/list-fixed-waits.py` did not count `<module>/tests.rs` as test code after M1
   moved the modules there (the inventory read 2 where the truth was 11), and the
   generated `0064-fixed-waits.txt` had not been regenerated since before Wave 29.

## 7. What this plan does not do

It does not touch what the code does, what the wire contract says or what CI verifies. It
removes copies, prose and scaffolding; the contract fixtures, the OpenAPI gate, the golden
files, `wave2_gate.rs` and the coverage floors are the tests a person actually wants and
they stay.
