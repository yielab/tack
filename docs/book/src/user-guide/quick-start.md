# Quick Start

Two ways to get Tack running: **install the binary** (the fast path — no build tools, you just want to use Tack) or **run from source in development mode** (for contributors and people who want hot reload). Pick the one that matches you.

Prefer pictures? The [Step-by-Step Tutorial](tutorial.md) walks this same page's install → project → tasks → agent-run path once, end to end, with a real screenshot at every step.

## Install

Tack is a single self-contained binary — the web UI, REST API, and SQLite engine are all inside one file. No runtime, database server, or container required. Pick any one method.

| Platform | Install → first agent attempt |
|---|---|
| Linux | `measured` |
| macOS | `not_measured` |
| Windows | `not_measured` |

**One line (Linux / macOS):**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yielab/tack/main/install.sh | sh
```

Verifies the download against that release's `SHA256SUMS` and refuses to install on a mismatch. Pin a version with `TACK_VERSION=v0.1.0-beta.9`; choose the install directory with `TACK_INSTALL_DIR` (default `~/.local/bin`).

**Homebrew (macOS and Linux):**

```sh
brew install yielab/tap/tack
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yielab/tack/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Same `TACK_VERSION` and `TACK_SKIP_CHECKSUM` env vars as above, plus `TACK_INSTALL_DIR` (default `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\tack`); it verifies `SHA256SUMS` and adds the install directory to your user `PATH` — open a new terminal afterwards. Or install with Scoop:

```sh
scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yielab/tack/main/packaging/scoop/tack.json
```

Or download the `.msi` from the [releases page](https://github.com/yielab/tack/releases).

**Desktop app.** Download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/yielab/tack/releases) — the `.AppImage` or `.deb` on Linux, the `.msi` on Windows, or the `.dmg` on macOS (built separately for Apple Silicon and Intel). Opening it starts the same server this page describes, inside its own window, with an icon in your system tray: closing the window leaves it running, and the tray's **Quit** is what actually stops it. If the server it started stops on its own, the tray tells you once — the status line reads "Server stopped" with the exit reason, and reopening the app starts it again; if the app is instead pointed at a server it did not start and that server goes quiet, the tray says so after a few seconds rather than staying silent. Skip to [First use](#first-use) once it's open.

**Docker:** the `ghcr.io/yielab/tack` image isn't publicly pullable yet — build it yourself from the repo's `Dockerfile` instead:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yielab/tack.git && cd tack
docker build -t tack:latest .
docker run -d --name tack -p 3210:3210 -v tack-data:/data tack:latest
```

See [Deployment → Docker](../developer/deployment.md#docker) for the compose file and configuration.

**Manual download.** Grab the archive for your platform and `SHA256SUMS` from the [releases page](https://github.com/yielab/tack/releases), verify, then run:

```sh
# Linux / macOS
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS   # macOS: shasum -a 256 -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS
tar xzf tack-*.tar.gz && cd tack-*/
./tack
```

On **Windows**, extract the zip and double-click `tack.exe`.

**From source.** No `cargo install` path exists yet — see [Development mode (run from source)](#development-mode-run-from-source) below.

> **First-run note (unsigned binary).** The binaries are not code-signed yet. On macOS, right-click → **Open** the first time (or run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine tack`). On Windows, click **More info → Run anyway** if SmartScreen appears.

## Start

```sh
tack            # starts the server + web UI at http://localhost:3210
```

Or start it with the embedded agent runner in one step — see [Run an item with an agent](#run-an-item-with-an-agent) below for what that adds:

```sh
tack serve --with-runner
```

Then open **`http://localhost:3210`** in your browser. On first start, Tack creates `tack.db` and a `storage/` folder next to the binary and runs the schema migrations automatically. Those two paths *are* your data — back them up and you've backed up everything.

**Verify the server is up:**

```sh
curl http://localhost:3210/api/health
# {"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0-beta.7","migrations_applied":62}
```

`migrations_applied` is how many migrations this build actually ran — trust that field over any number quoted here; it only grows as the schema does.

If this fails, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

## First use

1. **Create a project.** Click **New Project** on the Projects page, or press `Ctrl+K` and type "new project". Choose a **project type** — a template that pre-loads a matching [workflow](workflows.md) and [vocabulary](vocabulary.md) you can customize later.

2. **Add an item.** On the Board, click the **+** inside any column, or the **+ New** toolbar button. Give it a title and press Enter. An *item* is the basic unit of work — a task, bug, building, assignment, or whatever your vocabulary calls it.

3. **Move it.** Drag the card to another column. Status changes save immediately with optimistic UI (the card moves before the server confirms).

4. **Open the detail drawer.** Click the card body (not the drag handle) to see all fields, dependencies, comments, attachments, and custom fields. See [Working with Items](items.md).

5. **Find your way around.** Press `Ctrl+K` for the [command palette](command-palette.md) (jump to any view, run an action) or `Ctrl+/` to search items. Switch theme and palette from the sidebar footer — see [Appearance](appearance.md).

## Run an item with an agent

By default, nothing here executes anything: the server you started above is a full
project manager with agent execution off, and clicking an item's **Run with agent**
button shows "Agent execution is off" instead of a form. **Run with agent** (the
button) and `--with-runner` (a boot flag, further down) are two different things —
the button needs *some* runner active to do anything, and `--with-runner` is one way
to get one. The two paths below are alternatives, not sequential steps: pick the UI
path if a server is already running (no restart needed), or the CLI path if you're
starting fresh from a terminal.

**The UI-first path.** Open the **Agents** page from the sidebar (`/agents`). Four
steps, top to bottom, each one a switch or a form field — no terminal, no id to copy:

1. **"Agent execution on this machine"** — click **Turn on**. This is the one switch
   ADR 0061 decision 6 exists for: it starts an embedded runner in this same process,
   on this loopback bind, with no restart and no second binary. (A remote runner on a
   different machine still needs `tack-runner` started there — see
   [Enrolling a runner](agent-runners.md#enrolling-a-runner) — but nothing on *this*
   page requires that.)
2. **"Agents on this machine"** — once execution is on, this section reports what it
   found: `codex` and/or `claude-code`, present or not, and whether either one's own
   vendor login (Claude Max, `codex login`, ...) already works. Nothing to configure
   here if a harness is already installed and logged in.
3. **"Vercel AI Gateway key"** — paste a gateway key here if you don't want to rely on
   a harness's own subscription login. It is stored in the runner's own local secret
   store (the platform keychain where one exists, an owner-only file otherwise) —
   never in `tack.db`, never in a log, never echoed back by the API. Saving it
   immediately re-checks the gateway's model catalog; a real key shows real models
   below. If execution is already on, saving also restarts the embedded runner with
   the key, so the next run uses it — no "Re-check" needed in between.
4. **"Default model"** — pick a model from that catalog (or from whatever the target
   harness itself declares) and save it as this project's default. This is what lets
   the next step submit with zero hand-typed identifiers.

Now open any item and click **Run with agent**. With a runner active and a default
model configured, the dialog's defaults are already correct — confirm and click **Run**.
The item's own Execution tab shows the attempt's state, its requested-vs-actual model,
and its usage economics as they land.

**The CLI path** — scriptable, and what to reach for outside a browser. Every step
below is a real command against a real server, copied from an actual run; the fewest
steps from the binary you already have to a completed attempt, no second process and
no operator-issued token.

Start the server with the embedded runner instead of plain `tack` (it self-provisions
on first start — see [Standalone mode](agent-runners.md#standalone-mode-tack-serve---with-runner);
this is the console-command equivalent of step 1 above, not a second thing to do on top
of it):

```sh
tack serve --with-runner
```

In another terminal, create an agent profile — its instructions travel with every
request created against it:

```sh
tack agent-profile create "release-notes" \
  --instructions "Summarize the diff and write docs/CHANGELOG entries."
```

```text
Created agent profile: release-notes (ap_91b4e)
  id: ap_91b4ea76-9f1a-4725-8a58-21a57d92572c
```

Find the runner id — the embedded runner enrolled itself under it:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3210/api/runners | jq -r '.data[].runner_id'
```

Using the item id from [First use](#first-use) above, create the execution request
(swap in your own harness — `codex` or `claude-code` — and whichever model
it accepts; see [Choosing a model and a
provider](agent-runners.md#choosing-a-model-and-a-provider) if unsure):

```sh
tack execution create <ITEM_ID> \
  --runner <RUNNER_ID> \
  --agent-profile ap_91b4ea76-9f1a-4725-8a58-21a57d92572c \
  --harness claude-code --model-provider anthropic --model-id claude-sonnet-4-5 \
  --agent-profile-snapshot '{"name":"release-notes","instructions":"Summarize the diff and write docs/CHANGELOG entries.","tool_policy":{},"timeout_seconds":600,"budgets":{}}' \
  --repository '{"kind":"git","remote":"/path/to/your/repo","base_revision":"<COMMIT_SHA>","subdirectory":null}' \
  --permission-policy '{"tools":[],"network":false}' \
  --timeout-seconds 600
```

```text
Created execution request: exec_0fe
  state: queued
  id:    exec_0fe7252989f5f3d40a056c1da45b035039e4a8247ad89e5222cf9280134ec5d1
```

```sh
tack execution get exec_0fe7252989f5f3d40a056c1da45b035039e4a8247ad89e5222cf9280134ec5d1
```

```text
Execution request exec_0fe7252989f5f3d40a056c1da45b035039e4a8247ad89e5222cf9280134ec5d1
  state:   succeeded (done)
```

That is a completed attempt, reached either way. See [Running an item with an
agent](agent-runners.md#running-an-item-with-an-agent) for all four ways to create a
request and the full field-by-field reference.

## Development mode (run from source)

For contributing to Tack or running with hot reload. The API server and Vite dev server run as separate processes.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Rust toolchain** via [rustup](https://rustup.rs) (stable, 1.94+)
- **Node.js 22+** and npm

```sh
rustc --version
node --version
```

**Terminal 1 — API server:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yielab/tack.git
cd tack
cargo run -p tack-cli -- serve
```

The server binds to `http://127.0.0.1:3210` and runs migrations on first start.

**Terminal 2 — frontend dev server:**

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite starts at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies all `/api/*` requests to the API server. Open that URL in a browser.

### Build the single binary yourself

One process that serves both the API and the SPA — what the release archives ship:

```sh
# 1. Build the frontend
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..

# 2. Build the API with the embedded SPA
cargo build --release --features embed-spa -p tack-cli

# 3. Run it
./target/release/tack
# open http://127.0.0.1:3210
```

Without `--features embed-spa` the binary serves only the API; use the Vite dev server or any static file host for the frontend.
