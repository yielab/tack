# Vocabulary

Each project has a **VocabularyMap**: 16 configurable label keys that rename terms throughout
the UI. Two projects can use completely different language while running on the same underlying
system.

## The 16 Keys

| Key | Default | Construction example | Homework example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `task` | Task | Work Order | Assignment |
| `epic` | Epic | Building | Subject |
| `sprint` | Sprint | Phase | Week |
| `story` | Story | Scope | Topic |
| `bug` | Bug | Defect | Error |
| `feature` | Feature | Deliverable | Chapter |
| `project` | Project | Project | Course |
| `board` | Board | Board | Board |
| `column` | Column | Stage | Column |
| `backlog` | Backlog | Work Queue | Backlog |
| `item` | Item | Work Item | Item |
| `subtask` | Subtask | Sub-Order | Sub-task |
| `milestone` | Milestone | Milestone | Exam |
| `release` | Release | Handover | Semester |
| `tag` | Tag | Trade | Tag |
| `assignee` | Assignee | Contractor | Student |

All keys are optional. Omitted keys fall back to the default label.

## Changing Vocabulary

**In the UI:** Settings → Vocabulary → edit fields → Save. Changes take effect immediately
across all views for that project.

**Via API:**

```sh
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3210/api/projects/{id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vocabulary":{"task":"Work Order","sprint":"Phase","epic":"Building"}}'
```

Only include the keys you want to change; omitted keys are left as-is.

## Vocabulary is Per-Project

A "Sprint" in a software project and a "Phase" in a construction project are the same underlying concept — only the label differs. Vocabulary is scoped entirely to the project and does not affect other projects.

---

## CLI Behavior

The CLI displays vocabulary-mapped labels in human-readable mode. Use `--json` to bypass labels and get raw field names:

```sh
flexpm list --project <id>          # shows "Work Order" instead of "Task"
flexpm list --project <id> --json   # returns {"item_type":"task", ...}
```

## Practical Tip

Set vocabulary **before** adding items. Labels appear in the item creation form, board column headers, filter dropdowns, and export files. Changing vocabulary mid-project is safe (purely cosmetic) but can cause confusion in shared contexts.

Starter vocabulary for a construction project:

```json
{
  "task":      "Work Order",
  "epic":      "Building",
  "sprint":    "Phase",
  "story":     "Scope Item",
  "assignee":  "Contractor",
  "tag":       "Trade",
  "release":   "Handover",
  "milestone": "Milestone"
}
```
