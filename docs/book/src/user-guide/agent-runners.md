# Agent Runners & Fleet Execution

Tack can hand a board item to a coding agent — Codex, Claude Code, or OpenCode — and
track what it did as first-class project history: requested vs. actual harness/model,
a fenced execution attempt, an event timeline, decisions the agent needs answered, and
verified artifacts it produced. This page is the operator's guide to that surface:
running the `tack-runner` binary, enrolling and revoking runners, where credentials and
workspaces live, what a runner can honestly promise (the capability matrix), and how
version compatibility and network exposure work.

The question every new user asks first — *which model, from which provider, and where
do I put the key* — has a direct answer below, not a negation: see
[Choosing a model and a provider](#choosing-a-model-and-a-provider). The four ways to
turn a board item into a completed attempt are in
[Running an item with an agent](#running-an-item-with-an-agent), before the operational
detail (enrollment, credentials, recovery) that follows it.

This is a separate system from [Orchestration & the Fleet View](orchestration.md),
which covers Docket. Docket is optional and legacy here — see
[Docket compatibility](#docket-compatibility) below for exactly how the two relate.

**Read this before you rely on it in production:** the last section,
[What actually runs today](#what-actually-runs-today), states plainly which parts of
this pipeline are proven end-to-end against a real router and which parts stop at the
enrollment step in the current build. Every claim on this page cites the test that
proves it.

## Concepts

| Term | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Execution request** | A durable, idempotent record: "run this item through this harness, on this runner or fleet, with this agent profile." Created via `POST /api/executions`. |
| **Execution attempt** | One numbered try at a request. Owns a fencing token, a lease, and an isolated workspace. A request can have more than one attempt over its life (retries, recovery). |
| **Runner** | A `tack-runner` process, identified by a durable `runner_id`, enrolled once and then polling for work. |
| **Runner fleet** | A named group of runners sharing an optional concurrency limit and default policy. An execution request targets either one exact runner or a fleet. |
| **Agent profile** | Reusable instructions + tool policy + limits, snapshotted into the request at creation time so later edits to the profile never change history. |
| **Harness** | The coding-agent CLI a runner can launch: `codex`, `claude-code`, or `opencode`. |
| **Model profile** | A named `(model_provider, model_id)` pair, stored for operator convenience. Not yet consulted by scheduling or model resolution — see [Known gaps](#known-gaps). |

`Harness` ≠ `ModelProvider` ≠ `ModelId`, and `Item` ≠ `ExecutionRequest` ≠
`ExecutionAttempt` — these stay distinct on the wire and in the database on purpose;
see `docs/contracts/runner-v1/protocol.json`.

## Running an item with an agent

There are four ways to turn a board item into an execution request. All four produce
the identical `POST /api/executions` record underneath — none is more "real" than
another.

| Entry point | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| The **"Run with agent"** modal | Item detail drawer, web UI (`RunWithAgentModal.tsx`) | Five hand-typed fields today (runner/fleet, harness, model or Auto, timeout) and no memory between runs — see [Known gaps](#known-gaps). |
| `tack execution create` | CLI | Scriptable; every field the API accepts is a flag. Used for the worked example below. |
| `POST /api/executions` | Raw HTTP | Same JSON body the CLI sends. See [API Reference](../../../API-REFERENCE.md#runner-fleet--execution) for a worked request/response pair. |
| MCP `create_execution` | `tack mcp`, for an agent driving Tack itself | Same required fields as the REST call. See the [MCP guide](../../../MCP.md). |

The rest of this section is one complete run through the CLI path, executed against a
real `tack serve --with-runner` with a stand-in `claude` binary standing in for a real,
authenticated install (so it costs nothing and never leaves the machine) — every id and
every line of output below is copied from that run, not constructed from the schema.
Swap the stand-in for a real, logged-in harness and the same commands reach the same
place against real work.

**Before this:** a project and an item exist (`tack init`, `tack add`), and either a
real enrolled runner is polling (see [Enrolling a runner](#enrolling-a-runner) below) or
an embedded one is running (`tack serve --with-runner` — see
[Standalone mode](#standalone-mode-tack-serve---with-runner) below). `POST
/api/executions` requires all thirteen fields shown below; the CLI fills in an
`idempotency_key` (a fresh UUID) and empty objects for `budgets`/`environment`/`metadata`
if you omit them, so five of the thirteen are effectively optional in practice.

Create an agent profile — its instructions and limits are snapshotted into every
request created against it:

```sh
tack agent-profile create "demo-profile" \
  --instructions "Print the single word DONE and exit. Do not modify any files."
```

```text
Created agent profile: demo-profile (ap_91b4e)
  id: ap_91b4ea76-9f1a-4725-8a58-21a57d92572c
```

Find the runner to target. An embedded runner self-provisions under a name starting
`local-`; there is no `tack runner list` CLI subcommand today (see
[Enrolling a runner](#enrolling-a-runner)), so read it back over the API:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3210/api/runners | jq -r '.data[].runner_id'
```

```text
runr_8fa0dfb9-638f-492d-b278-ee06a789ad04
```

Now the full request, all thirteen required fields:

```sh
tack execution create <ITEM_ID> \
  --idempotency-key "release-notes-001" \
  --runner runr_8fa0dfb9-638f-492d-b278-ee06a789ad04 \
  --agent-profile ap_91b4ea76-9f1a-4725-8a58-21a57d92572c \
  --harness claude-code \
  --model-provider anthropic \
  --model-id claude-sonnet-4-5 \
  --agent-profile-snapshot '{"name":"demo-profile","instructions":"Print the single word DONE and exit. Do not modify any files.","tool_policy":{},"timeout_seconds":120,"budgets":{}}' \
  --repository '{"kind":"git","remote":"/path/to/local/repo","base_revision":"ce38796ef4f70db35eeb8d6d8b8e86477e1a883c","subdirectory":null}' \
  --permission-policy '{"tools":[],"network":false}' \
  --timeout-seconds 120
```

```text
Created execution request: exec_0fe
  state: queued
  id:    exec_0fe7252989f5f3d40a056c1da45b035039e4a8247ad89e5222cf9280134ec5d1
```

Poll for the terminal state — a fresh embedded runner claims and completes an attempt
against a stand-in harness in well under a second:

```sh
tack execution get exec_0fe7252989f5f3d40a056c1da45b035039e4a8247ad89e5222cf9280134ec5d1
```

```text
Execution request exec_0fe7252989f5f3d40a056c1da45b035039e4a8247ad89e5222cf9280134ec5d1
  item:    e1d5e03d-4610-45c2-b5f1-835e69f148a7
  state:   succeeded (done)
  created: 2026-09-03T19:00:16.697646760+00:00
```

That is a completed attempt, reached with the commands above and no browser. For the
attempt-level detail `tack execution get` does not surface — fencing token, workspace
id, the staged artifact, the harness's own capability report at claim time — use
`GET /api/executions/{request_id}/attempts`:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3210/api/executions/exec_0fe7252989.../attempts | jq '.data[0]'
```

```json
{
  "attempt_id": "att_fea7528f-853b-4c3c-a2d6-d1cf1b904e48",
  "state": "succeeded",
  "fencing_token": 1,
  "workspace_id": "ws_6174745f66656137353238662d383533622d346333632d613264362d643163663162393034653438",
  "actual_execution": {
    "harness_kind": "claude-code",
    "model_provider": "anthropic",
    "model_id": "unknown",
    "model_observation_source": "not_observed"
  },
  "terminal_reason": {
    "exit": "Exited(0)",
    "reason": "no structured result envelope was produced; inferred success from exit code 0",
    "artifact": { "kind": "log", "name": "claude-code-run.log", "size_bytes": 52 }
  }
}
```

Two things in that real output are worth reading closely rather than past: `model_id`
came back `"unknown"` with source `not_observed` — the stand-in binary used for this
page never echoes a model id the way a real harness does, and Tack reports that
honestly rather than assuming the requested id was actually the one that ran (the same
"not measured, never a fabricated value" rule as
[usage economics](#usage-economics-and-not-measured), applied to model identity instead
of cost). And `terminal_reason.reason` came from an *inferred* exit code, not a
structured result — a real harness's own structured output, when it produces one, is
read instead; see [What actually runs today](#what-actually-runs-today).

## Choosing a model and a provider

Two rules sit next to each other, on purpose, because keeping them apart is what caused
the confusion this section replaces: **Tack never holds a provider credential** — no
`TACK_*` variable configures an API key, an endpoint, or a gateway, ever
(`crates/tack-orch/src/scheduler/select.rs`; see [Non-loopback and security
posture](#non-loopback-and-security-posture) and, for the embedded runner specifically,
`docs/CONFIG.md`'s "Embedded runner" section) — and **Tack does route the model
choice**: which `(provider, model_id)` pair reaches the harness for a given request is
resolved server-side, deterministically, before the request is ever offered to a
runner. Neither rule contradicts the other: routing a choice and holding a secret are
different things, and Tack does the first without ever needing to do the second.

### The four-tier precedence

`crates/tack-orch/src/model_policy` resolves a request's model in this order, most
specific first, stopping at the first tier that has a value:

1. **Request override** — `requested_model_provider`/`requested_model_id` on the
   request itself (`--model-provider`/`--model-id` on the CLI, the `POST
   /api/executions` body fields of the same name). Set by an explicit CLI flag, a raw
   API caller, or the modal's model picker when it isn't left on "Auto".
2. **Agent-profile default** — a `{"default_model": {"provider": "...", "model_id":
   "..."}}` object inside the agent profile's own `limits` field (`POST
   /api/agent-profiles --limits '...'` or `tack agent-profile create --limits '...'`).
   Live-verified: creating a profile with this default and a request that omits
   `--model-provider`/`--model-id` entirely still resolves and completes:
   ```sh
   tack agent-profile create "sonnet-profile" \
     --instructions "..." \
     --limits '{"default_model":{"provider":"anthropic","model_id":"claude-sonnet-4-5"}}'
   # then tack execution create <item> --agent-profile ap_6e5649b8... --harness claude-code ... (no --model-provider/--model-id)
   ```
   the resulting attempt's `actual_execution.model_provider` came back `"anthropic"` —
   resolved server-side from the profile, never supplied on the request.
3. **Project default** — *no storage exists for this today.* `projects` has
   `vocabulary`/`workflow` JSON columns and no general-purpose settings column;
   `resolve_request_model_policy` always passes `None` for this tier
   (`crates/tack-orch/src/model_policy/wiring.rs`). A project-level default is not a
   partially-wired feature — it is a column that has not been added yet.
4. **Fleet default** — the same `{"default_model": {...}}` convention, inside
   `agent_fleets.default_policy` (`tack fleet create --policy '...'`). Applies only to a
   request that targets the fleet itself (`selector_kind: "fleet"`) — an
   `exact_runner`-targeted request never consults any fleet's policy, since it never
   names one. Live-verified the same way as tier 2: a fleet created with
   `--policy '{"default_model":{"provider":"anthropic","model_id":"claude-opus-4-1"}}'`,
   a request targeting `--fleet <that fleet>` with an agent profile that has no default
   of its own, resolved to `actual_execution.model_provider: "anthropic"`.
5. **Auto-select** — what happens when every tier above is empty. This is not a
   fallback that quietly picks something: see the next section.

All four tiers are resolved once, server-side, at request-creation time
(`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/executions.rs`, immediately before the request is
stored) — only when the caller supplied neither `requested_model_provider` nor
`requested_model_id`; an explicit pair (even a deliberately wrong one) is never
second-guessed by a lower tier.

### Auto-select does not schedule today

Leaving every tier empty is a real, acceptable-looking state to reach — the modal's
model picker defaults to "Auto (let the runner decide)", and a request created that way
is accepted and stored as `queued` with no error. But no runner-v1 capability field
attests that a harness safely accepts an unspecified model, so the scheduler rejects
every candidate for an auto-select request with `AutoSelectNotVerified`
(`crates/tack-orch/src/scheduler/select.rs`) rather than guess. **Live-verified:** a
request created with `requested_model_provider`/`requested_model_id` both `null` and no
tier above resolving to a value stayed `queued`, with zero attempts, indefinitely — no
`needs_operator`, no error surfaced anywhere an operator would see it. The only fix
today is to supply an explicit model somewhere in the four tiers above; there is
currently no operator-visible signal that distinguishes a genuinely queued request from
one that can never be scheduled.

### What a runner will actually accept

An explicit `(provider, model_id)` pair is eligible to schedule when either the target
harness's capability snapshot **declares** that exact pairing in `model_combinations`,
or the harness attests `model_passthrough: supported` (the adapter forwards the
operator's opaque model id verbatim and the harness validates it at its own run time).
`model_passthrough: advisory` is treated as unverified and rejected exactly like
`unsupported` — a capability claim below `supported` is not load-bearing
(`crates/tack-orch/src/scheduler/select.rs`). Run `tack runner doctor` on the actual
runner host to see this for real rather than trusting a stale copy of this page — the
full command and its unabridged output are in the [CLI reference](cli.md#runner).
Condensed from a real run on a machine with all three harnesses installed:

| Harness | `model_combinations` | `model_passthrough` |
|---|---|---|
| `codex` | (none reported) | supported |
| `claude-code` | (none reported) | supported |
| `opencode` | `llamacpp`: `qwen3.6-35b-uncensored`; `opencode`: `big-pickle`, `ling-3.0-flash-fin-free`, … | unsupported |

Codex and Claude Code both have no `list-models` command to probe, so both declare zero
combinations and rely entirely on passthrough — any operator-specified model is accepted
pre-spawn and only the harness itself validates it at run time. OpenCode's CLI does
enumerate real installed/configured models, so it declares them and refuses passthrough
— an undeclared OpenCode model is rejected before any process spawns, not after.

---

## Enrolling a runner

Enrollment is operator-initiated and two-step: the operator creates a *pending* runner
and gets a one-time token; the runner (or whoever configures it) redeems that token.

```sh
tack runner enroll my-first-runner \
  --total-capacity 2 \
  --available-capacity 2
```

```text
Enrolled runner: my-first-runner (runr_d91da686-...)
  token id:   ent_da7943b1-...
  expires at: 2026-08-19T16:17:51Z
  enrollment token: enr_57cd3592-...
  (shown once — copy it into the runner's TACK_RUNNER_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN now;
   it cannot be retrieved again)
```

The raw `enrollment_token` is generated by the server in this one response and is
**never stored anywhere retrievable again** — only its SHA-256 hash is kept
(`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/runners.rs`). If you lose it, revoke the token
(`tack runner revoke-token <runner-id> <token-id>`) and enroll again. Pass `--out
<path>` to write the response straight to an owner-only file instead of printing the
token to the terminal — useful when handing enrollment off to a provisioning script:

```sh
tack runner enroll ci-runner-1 --total-capacity 1 --available-capacity 1 \
  --out /secure/place/ci-runner-1.enrollment.json
```

Verified: `tack runner enroll` against a live server returns a `runner_id`,
`token_id`, and one-time `enrollment_token`, and a subsequent
`GET /api/runners` shows the runner in `pending_enrollment` state (there is no
`tack runner list` CLI subcommand today — only `enroll`/`revoke`/`revoke-token`; use
`curl` or the UI's Fleet view to list runners) — reproduced by hand for this page and
pinned by `crates/tack-api/tests/wave2_gate.rs` and the runner-lifecycle handler tests
in `crates/tack-api/src/handlers/runners.rs`.

### Redeeming the token (the runner side)

The runner process exchanges the enrollment token for a durable credential the first
time it starts:

```sh
export TACK_RUNNER_API_URL=https://tack.example.com/api/runner/v1
export TACK_RUNNER_ID=runr_d91da686-...
export TACK_RUNNER_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/tack-runner
export TACK_RUNNER_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN=enr_57cd3592-...
tack-runner
```

Prefer the environment variable over `--enrollment-token`: the flag exists but the CLI
help deliberately notes the env var keeps the secret out of shell history and process
listings. `RunnerConfig::require_enrollment_credential()` fails closed with a typed
error before any filesystem or network side effect if no credential is configured —
`crates/tack-runner/src/config.rs`.

### Revoking a runner

```sh
tack runner revoke runr_d91da686-...
```

Revocation is immediate: the runner's hashed credential stops authenticating on the
next request. It does not retroactively invalidate an already-issued lease's fencing
token — a mid-flight attempt still needs the ordinary lease/lifecycle machinery (see
the [recovery runbook](recovery-runbook.md)) to reach a terminal or `needs_operator`
state. Revoke an unredeemed enrollment token without touching the runner record with
`tack runner revoke-token <runner-id> <token-id>`.

---

## Standalone mode: `tack serve --with-runner`

Everything above assumes two processes: an operator running `tack serve`, and a
separate `tack-runner` process enrolled against it by hand. `tack serve --with-runner`
(or `TACK_LOCAL_RUNNER_ENABLE=1`) collapses that to one binary and one command — the
common case of one developer running an agent against their own board. It is off by
default; the full configuration reference (gate, state directory, provider-credential
story per harness) is `docs/CONFIG.md`, section "Embedded runner". This section covers
what changes about the enrollment/credential story above when you use it.

- **Not a shortcut.** The embedded runner runs as a task inside the server's own
  process, but speaks runner-v1 over loopback HTTP exactly like a remote runner — the
  same client, the same server-side path, the same contract fixtures. See
  `docs/adr/0058-standalone-single-binary-runner.md`.
- **Zero-touch enrollment on a fresh state directory.** The first start with no stored
  session self-provisions: it creates its own pending-runner row and redeems its own
  one-time token in-process. No `tack runner enroll` call is needed, and no token is
  ever printed, copied, or configured by hand. A second start against the same state
  directory reuses the stored credential on disk instead of provisioning a second
  runner — no second pending-runner row, no second token.
- **Loopback-only, refused before anything opens.** `TACK_HOST` must be a loopback
  address for `--with-runner` to start at all; a non-loopback bind is refused as a
  startup error — before any socket or database is opened — never downgraded to a
  runner-less server. Verified by `crates/tack-cli/src/local_runner.rs`'s
  `embedded_runner_refuses_non_loopback_bind` test and, live, by `scripts/smoke.sh`
  step 12: a real attempt to bind non-loopback with `--with-runner` exits non-zero
  naming "loopback", and no listener is ever opened on the refused port.
- **Off by default.** Plain `tack serve` — no flag, no environment variable — starts no
  runner at all. Verified live by `scripts/smoke.sh` step 11, which queries
  `GET /api/runners` directly after a settle window and finds it empty, not merely the
  absence of a log line.
- **Proven end to end.** `scripts/smoke.sh` step 10 drives `tack serve --with-runner` on
  a fresh state directory with no token, through self-provisioning, an active runner,
  and a real completed attempt, using the same fake-harness shim pattern the rest of the
  smoke script uses. See `docs/agent-handoffs/part-iv/IV-A6.md` for the recorded run.
- **Log visibility.** The embedded runner's own log lines are silent under default
  logging (a pre-existing tracing-filter gap, not specific to this mode) — see
  `docs/CONFIG.md`'s "Embedded runner" section for the exact `RUST_LOG` setting that
  surfaces them.

Everything else on this page — the capability matrix, workspace/artifact storage,
`needs_operator` recovery, version compatibility — applies identically whether the
runner is embedded or a separate process; the wire contract does not know the
difference.

---

## Local credential handling

- The enrollment token is a bearer secret; the durable credential the runner receives
  after redeeming it is a second, longer-lived bearer secret. Both are **hashed at
  rest** — the server never stores either in a form it could hand back to you.
- `EnrollmentCredential`'s `Debug` and `Display` implementations are hardcoded to
  print `[REDACTED]` — this is structural, not a logging convention that a future
  `println!` could bypass by accident (`crates/tack-runner/src/config.rs`).
- The runner's on-disk state directory (`TACK_RUNNER_STATE_DIR`, default
  `.tack-runner`) holds the attempt journal (below) and nothing else network-facing.
  Vendor/harness credentials (an OpenAI key, an Anthropic key, etc.) are the runner
  operator's own local environment — Tack's API never sees, stores, or forwards them.
- Logs never carry the credential value. Redaction is tested with a positive control:
  the redaction test in `f1_decisions_test.rs`/`f2_artifact_events_test.rs` captures
  real `tracing` output and asserts the secret marker never appears **and** an id
  does appear, ruling out "the capture rig just isn't observing anything."

---

## Workspace and artifact storage

Each execution *attempt* gets one isolated workspace — a dedicated worktree, never
shared across attempts or requests (`crates/tack-runner/src/workspace.rs`). The
`WorktreeProvisioner` trait is the only boundary allowed to create it; tests inject a
fake so unit tests never touch a real git checkout.

**On the runner side**, before any harness process is allowed to start, an owner-only
journal record is written to `TACK_RUNNER_STATE_DIR` describing the workspace path and
base revision (`crates/tack-runner/src/journal.rs`). This durability-before-spawn
ordering is what makes crash recovery possible — see the
[recovery runbook](recovery-runbook.md).

**On the server side**, verified artifacts a runner uploads (logs, diffs, generated
files — anything the harness produced worth keeping) are streamed to
`<TACK_STORAGE_DIR>/execution-artifacts`, a dedicated subtree kept apart from ordinary
item attachments (`<TACK_STORAGE_DIR>` itself) so the retention sweep documented below
can never touch the wrong directory
(`crates/tack-api/src/router.rs`, `with_artifact_storage_root`). Download is
`GET /api/executions/{request_id}/attempts/{n}/artifacts/{artifact_id}/content`, under
ordinary operator auth. There is currently **no list/discovery endpoint** for either
artifacts or decisions — see [known gaps](#known-gaps) below; an id has to already be
known (from the event timeline) to fetch it.

Content integrity is checksum-verified end to end:
`execution-attempt-detail.spec.ts` (III-F4) uploads real content through a real runner
credential, computes its own sha256, downloads it back through the UI via a real
Playwright download event, and asserts the downloaded bytes equal the uploaded bytes
exactly.

---

## Capability matrix

Every runner reports a **capability snapshot** at enrollment and refresh time —
protocol version, concurrency, installed harness versions, and per-feature support for
`cancel`, `resume`, `decisions`, `artifacts`, and `usage`, each as
`unsupported | advisory | supported` with an optional reason
(`docs/contracts/runner-v1/capabilities.json`). The scheduler and UI are required to
read this snapshot rather than assume a feature works.

**The one enforced rule:** no in-tree adapter may claim `cancel: supported`.
`AdapterRegistry::register_probe` rejects any probe that does, at registration time,
before any attempt can reference it — `crates/tack-runner/src/harness/mod.rs`, proved
by `harness::tests::registering_a_probe_that_overclaims_cancel_support_is_rejected_before_any_attempt_exists`.
The reason is structural, not a policy choice: every harness's own shell tool spawns
its subprocess in a new session outside the runner's process group, confirmed against
real `claude`, `codex`, and `opencode` binaries with `ps` during Wave 3
(`docs/agent-handoffs/part-iii/III-D5.md`, finding 1). `cancel` is `advisory`
everywhere in this build — a cancellation *request* is always honored as a request,
but the runner cannot promise the process actually stops.

| Feature | Ceiling in this build | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `cancel` | `advisory` (never `supported`) | Process-group cancellation is structurally unavailable across all three harnesses — `harness::tests::registering_all_three_real_adapters_is_order_independent` pins all three post-fix |
| `resume` | adapter-reported | No harness in this build declares a resumable session contract |
| `decisions` | adapter-reported | Runner-driven bounded decisions (`POST .../decisions`) work when the harness supports them |
| `artifacts` | `advisory` (all three adapters) | III-D5 found none of the three could guarantee artifact discovery; downgraded from an earlier `supported` claim |
| `usage` | `advisory` | Token totals may be absent from harness output; see [usage economics](#usage-economics-and-not-measured) |

---

## `needs_operator` and recovery

`needs_operator` is an explicit, non-automatically-retryable state for an attempt
whose ownership after a crash or network split cannot be proven safe. Tack never
blindly launches a second process against the same workspace. Full mechanics —
including exactly which recovery observations lead where — are in the
[Recovery Runbook](recovery-runbook.md); the short version:

1. A restarted runner reads its own journal and reports what it actually observed —
   `ProcessStopped`, `ProcessRunning`, or `Ambiguous`
   (`POST /api/runner/v1/attempts/{id}/recovery-observation`).
2. The server computes a disposition: `SafePreSpawnRequeue` (nothing had started yet —
   automatically safe), `NeedsOperator` (anything else), or `AlreadyTerminal`.
3. An operator resolves a `needs_operator` request explicitly, with an audited reason:

```sh
tack execution reconcile <request-id> \
  --recovery-key <key> \
  --reason "confirmed process was killed via ps on the runner host"
```

This calls `POST /api/executions/{id}/requeue`, which only succeeds for a request the
server itself authoritatively recovered — an unresolved or already-queued request
returns `409 invalid_transition` with the current state named in `details`, never a
silent no-op. Verified by hand against a live server (an unresolvable request returns
`{"code":"invalid_transition","details":{"from":"unknown","to":"queued"}}`) and pinned
by `crates/tack-cli/tests/e6_scheduler_e2e_test.rs`.

---

## Version compatibility

Every runner-v1 request body carries `"protocol_version": 1`. The server rejects
anything else outright — `check_protocol_version` in
`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/runner_protocol.rs` returns `unsupported-protocol`
(`docs/contracts/runner-v1/errors/unsupported-protocol.json`) for any value other than
the literal integer `1`, on every one of the 13 runner-protocol operations. There is
no negotiated fallback: a v2 protocol, if it ever exists, is a new contract revision,
not a version range this server tries to interpolate.

Separately, each runner reports its own `runner_version` (a free-form string in the
capability snapshot) and each harness reports its `installed_version` — both are
informational, logged and stored, never used to gate behavior today.

## Docket compatibility

Docket (the optional legacy agent-fleet backend) and the runner-v1 execution domain
described on this page are **structurally independent**. Docket absence does not
disable runner execution, and runner absence does not disable Docket's control-plane
polling — they share no table and no auth surface.

They share exactly one code path, deliberately: the **one-scheduling-owner** guard. In
`crates/tack-orch/src/adapters/legacy_bridge.rs`, `LEGACY_DOCKET_COMPATIBILITY_POLICY`
states the compatibility decision verbatim:

> Docket is maintained as an optional legacy bridge (`TACK_ORCH_ENABLE`, default off).
> It is never the owner of a new runner-v1 execution request; runner-v1 is this cycle's
> plan-of-record scheduler. An item with an active runner-v1 execution request refuses
> legacy Docket dispatch (one scheduling owner). Docket-origin work is identified with a
> provider-scoped id (`docket:<remote_task_id>`), distinct from any runner-v1 attempt or
> opaque model id.

That guard is one-directional today: an active runner-v1 request blocks a legacy Docket
dispatch, but creating a runner-v1 request on an item that already has an active
`orch_tasks` row is **not** refused. That gap is proven open by
`crates/tack-api/tests/g1_dual_dispatch_test.rs` rather than assumed closed. See
[Orchestration & the Fleet View](orchestration.md) for everything Docket-specific:
registering a control plane, dispatch, budgets, and why every dollar figure there says
"estimated." That surface is gated entirely behind `TACK_ORCH_ENABLE` and is unrelated
to whether any runner is enrolled.

## Non-loopback and security posture

Runner-protocol routes (`/api/runner/v1/*`) are mounted as a structural **sibling** of
the operator `/api` router, not nested inside it — they never traverse
`require_token` (the operator bearer-token gate) at all, and each handler
authenticates its own hashed runner credential independently
(`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/runner_protocol/runner_auth.rs`). This is deliberate:
a future edit that widens the operator auth exemption list cannot accidentally loosen
runner auth, because runner auth was never implemented as an exemption in the first
place.

For everything else about exposing Tack beyond `127.0.0.1` — TLS termination behind a
reverse proxy, `TACK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `TACK_API_TOKEN`, request body limits — see
[Administration and Security](administration.md), which applies identically whether or
not any runner is enrolled. The one addition specific to this domain:
`TACK_EXECUTION_DECISION_TOKEN` and `TACK_ORCH_APPROVAL_TOKEN` are **separate,
higher-privilege secrets** layered on top of `TACK_API_TOKEN`, both fail-closed when
unset (the route rejects rather than silently falling back to the ordinary operator
token) and never logged. See `docs/CONFIG.md` for every `TACK_*` variable in this
domain.

`tack serve --with-runner` (see "Standalone mode" above) adds a second, stricter
loopback requirement on top of all of this: an embedded runner executes arbitrary
coding-agent processes on the same host serving the UI, so `--with-runner` itself
refuses to start unless `TACK_HOST` is a loopback address — independent of, and checked
before, whichever `TACK_API_TOKEN`/`TACK_API_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_NONLOOPBACK` posture
the server would otherwise apply.

## Usage economics and "Not measured"

`usage_economics.runner_time_cost.cost_usd_estimated` is **always**
`{value: null, source: "not_measured"}` in production — no runner infra cost-rate is
stored anywhere in this schema, so there is nothing honest to compute it from. The UI
renders the literal string `Not measured`, never `$0.00`: rendering zero would claim
the run was free, which is not known to be true.
`attemptFormat.test.ts#formatUsdMeasurement` asserts the exact string, that it does
**not** contain `$0`, and — as a positive control — that a real
`{value: 0, source: "measured"}` renders the genuinely different `"$0.00 (measured)"`,
proving the two cases are distinguished rather than both collapsing to one string.

Token usage, when the harness reports it, is `measured`. When it doesn't, it is
`not_measured` — never a structural zero standing in for "unknown."

## Known gaps

These are documented rather than papered over, per this project's
"unsupported is typed, unknown is explicit" rule. Two of the bullets that used to sit
here (`model_profiles` and `agent_fleet_members`, below) were re-checked against the
running code while writing this page and turned out to already be false — corrected
rather than silently dropped, since a reader who remembered the old claim deserves to
see it was wrong and why:

- **No decision- or artifact-discovery/list endpoint exists.** `resolve_decision` and
  the artifact-content download route both require an already-known id; there is no
  `GET .../decisions` or `GET .../artifacts` list route anywhere in the codebase
  (confirmed by reading every handler touching `execution_decisions` and
  `execution_artifacts`). `DecisionInbox.tsx` and `ArtifactDownloadPanel.tsx` in the
  frontend are built and tested against this reality — they accept a manually-entered
  id today. See `docs/agent-handoffs/part-iii/III-F4.md` for the concrete route shape
  requested to close this.
- **`model_profiles` (migration 043) is a saved label, not a scheduling input.**
  `POST`/`GET /api/model-profiles` store and list named `(provider, model_id)` pairs
  for operator convenience; `resolve_request_model_policy` never reads that table — it
  is not one of the four tiers in [Choosing a model and a
  provider](#choosing-a-model-and-a-provider) (`crates/tack-orch/src/model_policy/wiring.rs`).
  The "Run with agent" modal reads the list to populate its model picker, then copies
  the chosen pair into the request's own `requested_model_provider`/`requested_model_id`
  — the *highest*-precedence tier — before the request is created
  (`frontend/src/shared/runWithAgent/RunWithAgentModal.tsx`). A model profile has real
  effect through that copy, never by being consulted as a default itself.
- **`projects` has no default-model-policy storage.** `ModelPolicySources.
  project_default` is modeled in the response shape but is always `None`.
- **`agent_fleet_members` has a write route; nothing in the UI calls it yet.**
  `POST /api/runner-fleets/{fleet_id}/members` and `DELETE
  .../members/{runner_id}` exist and work (`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/runner_admin.rs`)
  — live-verified for this page:
  ```sh
  curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3210/api/runner-fleets/<fleet_id>/members \
    -d '{"runner_id":"<runner_id>"}'
  ```

  ```text
  {"protocol_version":1,"fleet_id":"fleet_64ab2a19-...","runner_id":"runr_8fa0dfb9-...","state":"added"}
  ```
  but the Fleet panel in the web UI has no control that calls either route — adding a
  runner to a fleet today means calling the API directly.
- **`execution_requests` has no real `priority` column.** A `metadata`-convention
  stopgap exists, documented as non-binding.
- **Webkit could not be evaluated** in this build environment (missing
  `libwoff2dec.so.1.0.2`, no `sudo` to install it) — chromium and firefox Playwright
  coverage is green; webkit's status is genuinely `not_measured`, not failing.

## What actually runs today

Read this section before treating any earlier claim on this page as a promise about a
live, end-to-end run.

**Proven end-to-end against the real production router** (`build_router`, no
card-local test scaffolding): creating an execution request, scheduling it to an exact
runner or a fleet, the full runner-v1 protocol surface (enroll → claim → heartbeat →
accept → start → events → decisions → artifacts → completion), cancellation and
recovery-observation handling, the decision-resolve and artifact-download routes, and
the retention/expiry sweeps — see `crates/tack-api/tests/wave2_gate.rs`,
`crates/tack-orch/tests/runner_contract.rs` (byte-pins all 46 frozen fixtures), and the
Wave 5/6 integrator test files referenced throughout this page.

**The `tack-runner` binary's own network transport is wired and proven — this section
used to say otherwise; that gap has since closed.** `tack_runner::bootstrap::build_runtime`
(the one composition root both the standalone `tack-runner` binary and the embedded
`tack serve --with-runner`/`tack runner start` paths call — see "Standalone mode"
above) wires the real `HttpPullProtocol`, not `UnavailableProtocolClient`.
`UnavailableProtocolClient` still exists in the crate as an explicit no-client
fallback — reachable only if something constructs a runtime without attaching a
protocol client — and stays pinned by
`runtime::tests::unavailable_protocol_is_a_typed_failure_not_success` precisely so that
path fails as a typed `RunnerError::ProtocolUnavailable` rather than a silent success;
it is not what a real `tack-runner` startup wires today.

Live, end-to-end proof of the real client: `crates/tack-runner/tests/
bootstrap_entrypoint.rs` proves the composition root itself is reachable and
shutdown-controllable from outside the crate against a real (mocked) HTTP enrollment
exchange. Every run of `scripts/smoke.sh` exercises the real client against a real
server: steps 6-9 enroll a separate `tack-runner` process and drive a real attempt
through claim → checkout → harness → completion, restart recovery included; step 10
does the same inside a single `tack serve --with-runner` process. **A fresh-machine
operator today can enroll a runner and point a real `tack-runner` process (standalone
or embedded) at a real server and watch it enroll, claim, and complete real work** —
see `docs/agent-handoffs/part-iv/` (`IV-A1` through `IV-A6`) for how this was built and
proven, and `docs/agent-handoffs/part-iii/III-G3.md` for the original escalation this
section used to describe.
