## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A project can name its own default agent model.** Model choice gains a project tier
  between the agent profile and the fleet default, edited from the Agents panel in project
  settings; a run that takes the value reports `project` as its provenance.
- **The runner resolves secret references.** A claim's environment entry can carry a
  `secret_reference`, which the runner now resolves from the OS keychain, or from an
  owner-only file where no keychain answers. Managed with `tack runner secret
  set|list|remove`; `tack runner doctor` names the backend that answered. Previously every
  harness adapter dropped the reference with a warning, so a run looked healthy while the
  key never arrived.
- **`tack service install|uninstall|status`** registers the board as a per-user background
  service — systemd user units, launchd, or a Windows scheduled task — so work outlives the
  window that started it. No root on any platform.
- **An attempt's artifacts and decisions are listable**: `GET
  /api/executions/{request_id}/attempts/{attempt_number}/artifacts` and `.../decisions`,
  operator-gated and read-only. The decision inbox and artifact panel fetch these instead of
  asking for an id you would have to know already.
- **`tack-desktop`**, a Tauri shell that owns a window and a desktop icon and supervises
  `tack` as a bundled sidecar — attaching to a server that already answers, starting one
  only when none does. Built with `make desktop`.

### Changed

- **Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.89** (was 1.85). Edition 2024 still only needs
  1.85, but the dependency graph does not: `object_store` pulls `crc-fast` (1.89),
  `tracing-appender` pulls `time` (1.88), and the `idna`/`icu` stack needs 1.86.
  `cargo +1.89.0 build --workspace --locked` is clean.

### Fixed

- **The Rust toolchain is pinned to an exact version, so a green local check predicts CI.**
  `rust-toolchain.toml` said `stable`, which resolves to whatever stable is on the day —
  and the local one had fallen three minor versions behind CI's. Clippy lints that shipped
  in between failed CI while passing locally, twice. The pin is now `1.98.1`, rustup ranks
  the file above whatever a setup action selects, and Dependabot maintains the pin via the
  `rust-toolchain` ecosystem. Three `chunks_exact` sites the newer clippy rejects are
  rewritten as `as_chunks`; the SHA-256 implementation still matches its published test
  vectors.
- **`tack-desktop` is its own Cargo workspace, so the server still builds without a
  desktop.** As a workspace member it pulled GTK, WebKit and glib into every
  `cargo build --workspace` — CI's Rust, MSRV and embed-spa jobs all failed with
  `The system library 'glib-2.0' ... was not found`, and a contributor on a headless
  machine could not have built the server at all. It now has its own lockfile, its own CI
  job, and its own Dependabot entry; `make desktop` builds it. A new test fails if its
  version drifts from the root workspace's, since it can no longer inherit it.
- **Generated files can no longer produce a merge conflict.** `Cargo.lock`,
  `frontend/package-lock.json`, `docs/openapi.json` and
  `frontend/src/shared/api/schema.gen.ts` are marked `merge=tack-generated`; the driver
  resolves them without a conflict, `.githooks/post-merge` regenerates them from the merged
  sources, and `.githooks/pre-push` now refuses to push a stale lockfile or TypeScript
  schema. `./scripts/setup-git.sh` registers the hooks and the driver in a clone (it
  replaces the `git config core.hooksPath` line in the contributing guide);
  `./scripts/regen-generated.sh` runs the regeneration by hand.
- **Dependabot's two halves are configured separately.** Version updates move to a monthly
  cadence with a cooldown (30 days for majors, 7 for minors, 3 for patches) so a
  freshly published release is not this repository's problem to discover. Security updates
  are enabled at the repository level for the first time and get their own group per
  ecosystem via `applies-to: security-updates`, so an advisory is never delayed by the
  batching that exists to slow chores down. Previously the noisy half was on and the
  valuable half was off, and advisories were only ever fixed as a side effect of a routine
  roll-up.
- **CI's MSRV job now builds on the version it pins.** `rust-toolchain.toml` selects
  `stable`, and rustup ranks a toolchain file above the default that the setup action sets,
  so the job had been building on stable since it was created — a green check that verified
  nothing about the floor, which is how the dependency graph drifted three minor versions
  past the documented MSRV unnoticed.

### Removed

- The Amazon Alexa voice integration: `POST /api/alexa`, `TACK_ALEXA_SKILL_ID`,
  `TACK_ALEXA_SHARED_SECRET`, the `alexa_skill_id` / `alexa_shared_secret` keys in
  `tack.toml`, `docs/ALEXA.md`, and the Cloudflare tunnel hooks in `make run` / `make dev`
  that existed only to give that endpoint a public HTTPS URL. The endpoint had been off by
  default since it shipped. A `tack.toml` that still sets the keys is accepted and ignored;
  the `tunnel` make target is gone.

## [0.1.0-beta.7] - 2026-08-31

The harness-agnostic runner fleet built since `v0.1.0-beta.6` — a durable execution
domain, the pull-based `tack-runner` binary, and real Codex/Claude Code/OpenCode harness
adapters (Phases 50–57; see the
[roadmap](docs/book/src/roadmap.md#next--harness-agnostic-runner-fleet-phases-5057) for the
full capability table) — is downloadable for the first time in this release. CI has
packaged `tack-runner` into its own per-platform archive since `7d78de3` (2026-08-19); the
gap since then was purely that no tag had been cut to put it on a release page.

**Live-harness status, measured against the real `claude`, `opencode`, and `codex`
binaries (`./scripts/smoke.sh --live`):** `claude-code` and `opencode` complete real live
attempts end to end. `codex` now runs the full production pipeline for the first time —
claimed, checked out, spawned, given a real network call, and its error captured and
reported correctly — but has not completed a live attempt on this machine. The remaining
blocker is external: the connected Codex account does not have access to the specific
model the smoke test requests (`"The 'gpt-5-codex' model is not supported when using Codex
with a ChatGPT account."`), an account-tier limitation, not a defect in this codebase. Two
real defects that were obscuring this picture until now are fixed below.

The install command in `README.md` (`curl -fsSL … | sh`) is live: `main` is published,
`verify-install-urls.yml` checks every documented install URL on every push so a broken
path can't silently recur, and it's now also the repository's default branch.

### Fixed

- **A long-running live task no longer gets stuck at "running" forever.** Any harness
  (Codex, Claude Code, or OpenCode — any model) whose real task ran past about 60 seconds
  had its server-side lease silently expire while `tack-runner` still believed it held it;
  the eventual completion report was then rejected as stale and the task was left
  permanently `running` with no error, even across a runner restart. `tack-runner` now
  renews its lease every 20 seconds for as long as the harness is actually still running.
- **Codex could never be scheduled, on any machine.** Its startup version probe required
  the installed binary's `--version` output to be a bare `X.Y.Z` string with nothing else;
  the real `codex-cli` binary prints a program name first (`codex-cli 0.149.1`), so the
  probe always rejected it and the scheduler refused to place any work on it regardless of
  what else it declared. The probe now scans for a version token instead of requiring the
  whole line to be one.
- **A failed heartbeat could retry without backoff.** Observed only as a side effect of the
  stuck-task bug above (thousands of heartbeat attempts a second against a lease that could
  never become valid again); `tack-runner` now backs off before retrying a failed heartbeat,
  matching its other retry paths.
- **CI was red on every push.** A harness-registration test assumed a real `codex` CLI is
  on `PATH` — true in local dev, false on GitHub's runners — and failed there
  deterministically; the Windows release build failed outright on an import of a
  unix-only function; the frontend SBOM job failed on an internally inconsistent
  `lightningcss` lockfile resolution. All three fixed and verified (the first two by
  reproducing the CI-only conditions locally, not just inferring the fix).

### Added

- **`tack-runner` release archives**, first available on a release page with this tag. The
  release workflow builds `tack-runner` with `cargo auditable` and packages it per platform
  in its own archive, alongside the systemd unit and env example, so a fleet host can be
  provisioned without the server/SPA bundle. (Part III, III-G4.)
- **Install URL verification.** `scripts/verify-install-urls.sh` and a matching CI workflow
  resolve every install URL this project documents and fail on any non-2xx response, so a
  broken install path (see Known issue above) cannot silently persist or recur.
- **Harness-agnostic runner fleet (Phases 50–57).** A durable execution domain, the
  pull-based `tack-runner` binary, real Codex/Claude Code/OpenCode harness adapters, fleet
  scheduling, decisions, artifacts, and model profiles. See the
  [roadmap](docs/book/src/roadmap.md#next--harness-agnostic-runner-fleet-phases-5057) for
  the definition-of-done table and `docs/agent-handoffs/part-iii/` for per-card evidence.
- **`README.md` rewritten** as a standard open-source landing page (features, screenshots,
  requirements, install, status, architecture), with screenshots and the hero GIF
  regenerated against the current UI.

### Security

- **Dependency and license audit cleared.** `cargo audit`/`npm audit` had drifted to 3
  Rust advisories (`h2` unbounded empty DATA frames, `quick-xml` quadratic parsing and
  unbounded namespace allocation) and 7 npm advisories (`brace-expansion`, `js-yaml`,
  `nanoid`, `postcss`, `undici`); all resolved via lockfile-only updates, no `Cargo.toml`/
  `package.json` version bump needed. Separately, `cargo-deny`'s CI license gate was
  failing outright: five of six workspace crates never declared
  `license.workspace = true` (only `tack-runner` did) so they read as unlicensed
  regardless of the allow-list, and `CDLA-Permissive-2.0` (the license
  `webpki-root-certs`/`webpki-roots` ship under) was missing from the allow-list.

> **Audit-driven cycle (Phases 26–32, July 2026).** A full-repo audit produced a
> correctness/security/quality cycle, now implemented and verified (244 Rust tests,
> 169 Vitest, clippy clean). Grouped below under Fixed / Security / Added / Changed.

### Fixed

- **Item updates no longer silently drop data** — `update_item` now persists
  `sprint_id`, `due_date`, and `estimate_unit` (previously ignored, so drag-to-sprint
  and due-date edits vanished on refresh); null clears them. `started_at`/
  `completed_at` are now stamped on ordinary status transitions, so due-soon
  webhooks stop firing for completed items. (Phase 26.)
- **Foreign keys enforced on every connection** — `foreign_keys=ON` is now a
  per-connection option instead of running on one pooled connection. (Phase 26.)
- **Item lists no longer truncate at 100 in the UI** — the list endpoint returns a
  `{data,total,page,per_page}` envelope and the client pages through all items.
  (Phase 29.)
- **Navigation** — breadcrumbs render for the Table and Sprints views; the Table
  lens is reachable from the sidebar. (Phase 26.)

### Security

- **Alexa endpoint hardened** — an optional mandatory shared secret
  (`TACK_ALEXA_SHARED_SECRET`, constant-time compared) gates the endpoint; the old
  skill-ID-only check was forgeable. (Phase 27.1; see [docs/ALEXA.md](docs/ALEXA.md).)
- **Backup restore integrity** — bundles are rejected on tar path traversal, SHA-256
  mismatch, or unsupported format version before anything is staged; the S3 secret
  and install ID are scrubbed from every snapshot so they no longer ride inside
  backup bundles. (Phase 27.3/27.4/27.6.)
- **Exposed-bind warning** — binding a non-loopback host with no `TACK_API_TOKEN`
  now logs a loud startup warning; `/api/debug/info` no longer returns the database
  URL. (Phase 27.2.)
- **Injection + validation** — Linear import escapes `team_id`/`project_id` in the
  GraphQL query; GitHub/Linear import, board, sprint-status, template-instantiation,
  and backup-settings DTOs are now validated (`retention` ≥ 1, interval ≥ 60).
  (Phase 27.5/27.7.)

### Added

- **OpenAPI 3.1 contract** — the API is now described by a machine-generated spec
  (`utoipa`), served at `GET /api/openapi.json` and committed to
  [docs/openapi.json](docs/openapi.json) (68 operations / 43 paths, no bundled
  Swagger UI). Two CI drift gates keep handlers → `docs/openapi.json` →
  `frontend/src/shared/api/schema.gen.ts` in lockstep, and both API-reference docs
  now point at the spec as the source of truth. (Phase 29.3–29.6.)
- **Backup → safe multi-device sync** — a generation counter with upload/restore
  conflict detection (`force` to override), fail-safe restore swaps (stale WAL
  cleanup, rollback-on-failure, backup-before-restore), sidecar-first + multipart
  uploads with orphan reconciliation, and a `POST /api/backup/remote/verify`
  preview wired into Settings → Cloud Backup. (Phase 28.)
- **Construction build-system presets** — three seeded templates (Wood Frame, Steel
  Frame, SIP Panel) with tailored workflows and build-specific custom fields; the
  New Project dialog is now template-first with a workflow + vocabulary preview.
  (Phase 31.)
- **Enterprise OSS scaffolding** — `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`, release
  integrity (SHA256SUMS, build provenance, CycloneDX SBOMs), `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `GOVERNANCE.md`, GitHub Security Advisories disclosure, and CI gates for MSRV
  (Rust 1.85), coverage, and `cargo-deny`. (Phase 32.)

### Changed

- **Items gained optimistic concurrency** — `GET /api/items/{id}` now returns an
  `ETag`; `PATCH /api/items/{id}` honors a matching `If-Match` and rejects a stale
  one with `412 Precondition Failed`. An absent `If-Match` behaves exactly as
  before, so no existing client (the MCP tools, the Alexa skill, any pre-upgrade
  caller) is affected. **Behavior change:** the auto-dispatch hook's enable check
  now reads the *effective* orchestration setting (the Settings UI toggle,
  falling back to `TACK_ORCH_ENABLE`) instead of the raw env flag alone — an
  operator who started the server with `TACK_ORCH_ENABLE=1` and then switched
  orchestration off in Settings previously still got auto-dispatch on every
  eligible status change; it now correctly stays off. (Phase 41, card G3.)

- **`orch_runs` and `orch_approvals` were rebuilt in place — back up first.**
  `orch_runs.run_id` is renamed to `external_run_id` and the primary key widens to
  `(control_plane_id, external_run_id, run_attempt)`, with a new, Tack-minted
  `correlation_id` column (`NULL` on every pre-existing row); `orch_approvals.
  control_plane_id` becomes nullable and the table gains `kind`, `external_id`, and
  `provider_metadata`. Every existing row is carried across unchanged — `run_attempt`
  backfills to `1`, `kind` backfills to `'approval'` — but this is the **only**
  migration in the cycle that rewrites existing rows rather than just adding a
  column, and it is not reversible. **If your database has ever registered a
  control plane, take a backup (`GET /api/backup`) before upgrading.** `run_all`
  now also refuses to start if either rebuild is left half-applied (both the
  original table and its `_new` staging table present, e.g. after a crash
  mid-upgrade), naming the backup endpoint in the error, rather than replaying
  `DROP TABLE` against whichever rows survived. (Phase 42, card G5b.)

- **Per-project vocabulary now covers every surface** — the "+ New" modal, Sprints
  view, tabs, command palette, and first-run guide resolve project terms, so a
  construction project reads "Phase"/"Work Order" everywhere. Error responses share
  one `{"error":{"status","message"}}` envelope; priority colors are tokenized for
  dark-mode/palette correctness. (Phases 29.1/30.)

- **GitHub push sync (v1, push-only)** — items imported from GitHub are now linked
  to their issue (new `github_links` table). When `TACK_GITHUB_TOKEN` is set,
  completing a linked item **closes** its GitHub issue (and moving it back out of
  Done **reopens** it). Best-effort and fire-and-forget — never blocks the update.
  `TACK_GITHUB_API_BASE` overrides the API root (GitHub Enterprise / testing). See
  [docs/GITHUB-SYNC.md](docs/GITHUB-SYNC.md). (Phase 21, push-only slice; inbound
  sync and comment mirroring remain future work.)
- **YAML project export/import** — `GET /api/projects/{id}/export?format=yaml`
  produces a plaintext, git-diffable snapshot; the import endpoint round-trips it
  back (parsed as YAML when `Content-Type` mentions YAML, else JSON). Exposed in
  **Settings → Data** (Export YAML, and import now accepts `.yaml`/`.yml`).
  (Phase 25, Task 1.)
- **Table density toggle** — the Table view now switches between comfortable and
  compact row spacing, persisted to `localStorage`. (Phase 23, Task 2.)
- **One-line installer** — `curl -fsSL …/install.sh | sh` resolves the newest
  release asset for your platform from the GitHub API (Linux/macOS, x86_64 +
  Apple Silicon) and installs the single `tack` binary. Also documented
  `cargo install --git … tack-cli --features embed-spa`. (Phase 24, Task 2.)
- **`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`** — measured, reproducible footprint and latency
  (10.3 MiB binary, ~113 ms cold start, ~12 MiB idle RSS, sub-3 ms p99 reads) plus
  a README "Why Tack" comparison table vs Plane/Vikunja/Huly. (Phase 24, Task 1.)
- **Table view** — a sixth work lens: a sortable, filterable, column-configurable
  grid with inline editing of title, status, priority, assignee, and due date
  (edits round-trip through the API, so workflow rules apply and other views update
  over WebSocket). Headers respect per-project vocabulary; column visibility
  persists to `localStorage`. Reachable via the Table tab, `/projects/:id/table`,
  and the command palette. (Phase 23, Task 1.) Also threads `assignee` through the
  frontend `Item`/`UpdateItem` types (previously backend/CLI-only).
- **Three new domain project types** — `legal` (case management:
  Intake → Discovery → Drafting → Review → Closed; vocabulary Matter/Case/Filing/
  Counsel/…), `research` (lab: Hypothesis → Design → Experiment → Analysis →
  Published; Study/Experiment/Protocol/Researcher/…), and `event` (planning:
  Ideas → Booked → In Progress → Confirmed → Done; Event/Track/Run Sheet/…). Each
  ships a workflow + vocabulary preset and a seeded built-in template, and is
  selectable in the CLI (`tack init -t legal`) and the New Project dialog.
  (Phase 24, Task 3.)
- **`tack mcp` — Model Context Protocol server.** Exposes a Tack instance to AI
  agents (Claude Code, Codex, …) over stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0). Eight tools:
  `list_projects`, `list_items`, `get_item`, `search_items`, `create_item`,
  `update_item`, `move_item`, `add_comment`. Writes go through the REST API, so
  workflow validation, WIP limits, and parent-auto-completion still apply. See
  [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md) for the Claude Code config. (Phase 20.)
- **`tack branch <item-id>`** — derives a conventional git branch name from an
  item (`<prefix>/<short-id>-<title-slug>`, e.g. `feat/a1b2c3d4-add-table-view`).
  Prints the `git checkout -b …` command by default, creates and switches with
  `--checkout`, overrides the type-derived prefix with `--prefix`, and supports
  `--json`. (Phase 22, Task 1.)

### Changed

- **UI redesign — teal multi-palette design system.** The frontend was rebuilt on
  a two-axis design-token system: mode (light/dark) × palette (Teal / Clay /
  Graphite), switchable from the sidebar footer. Every color now flows from
  `--color-*` tokens in `index.css` — components no longer use raw hex — and the
  type stack moved to self-hosted Hanken Grotesk + JetBrains Mono. This is the
  largest user-facing change since beta.6.

### Fixed

- **WCAG AA contrast across the redesigned palette.** Adjusted token values so
  text and interactive elements meet WCAG AA contrast in all three palettes in
  both light and dark mode; the axe accessibility scan gates on a clean baseline
  in CI.

---

## [0.1.0-beta.6] - 2026-06-22

### Security

- **quinn-proto 0.11.14 → 0.11.15** — fixes RUSTSEC-2026-0185 (high: remote
  memory exhaustion via unbounded out-of-order stream reassembly), clearing the
  failing `cargo audit` gate.

### Changed

- Dependency maintenance, consolidating the open Dependabot PRs:
  - **tower-http 0.6 → 0.7**, **sha2 0.10 → 0.11**, **hmac 0.12 → 0.13** (the
    HMAC webhook signing now imports `KeyInit` for `new_from_slice`).
  - In-semver cargo minor/patch bumps (tokio, axum, serde_json, chrono, uuid,
    clap, tracing-appender, hyper, h2, …).
  - Frontend: **@solidjs/router 0.15 → 0.16**, tailwindcss 4.3, solid-js 1.9.13,
    vitest 4.1.9, @playwright/test 1.61, and the rest of the npm minor/patch group.
  - CI: `actions/checkout` v4 → v7.

---

## [0.1.0-beta.5] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Cloud backup in the UI.** A new **Settings → Cloud Backup** section configures
  an external S3-compatible destination (Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, AWS S3, MinIO)
  directly in the app — endpoint, bucket, region, access/secret key, prefix, and
  retention. A connection-status badge, a **Back up now** (sync) button, a
  **Restore latest** button, and a list of existing cloud backups with per-item
  restore make the whole flow one-click.
  - New endpoints `GET`/`PUT /api/settings/backup`. Settings are stored in a new
    `app_meta` table (migration 017) and override the `TACK_BACKUP_*` env defaults.
    The secret key is write-only — never returned to clients.
- **Version is now visible in the UI** — in the sidebar footer (previously a
  hardcoded "v1.0") and at the top of the Settings page, read live from
  `/api/health`.

### Changed

- The remote-backup endpoints now resolve their effective configuration from the
  DB-stored settings (falling back to env), so UI changes take effect immediately
  for manual backups and restores.

---

## [0.1.0-beta.4] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- **One executable instead of two.** The server and the CLI are now a single
  `tack` binary. Running `tack` with no arguments (or `tack serve`) starts the
  server and web UI — the primary, UI-first experience — while `tack <command>`
  (e.g. `tack add`, `tack list`) is the optional CLI client. Previously the
  release shipped both a `tack-api` server binary and a separate `tack` CLI,
  which was confusing.
- The server entry point now lives in the `tack-api` library (`tack_api::serve`);
  the `tack-api` crate no longer produces its own binary.
- Release archives now contain a single binary; the `tack-api` binary is gone.
- Corrected the advertised binary size in the README (~10 MB on disk, ~6 MB
  compressed download — the previous "5 MB" predated embedding the web UI).

---

## [0.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-06-18

First public beta under the **Tack** name and the `yielab` GitHub organization.
No functional changes to the application itself — this release rebrands, relocates,
and hardens the project for its public debut.

### Changed

- **Renamed the project FlexPM → Tack** across the codebase, CLI, docs, and binaries.
- **New brand:** redesigned logo (Kanban-T mark, indigo-fuchsia gradient) with
  regenerated README screenshots and hero animation.
- **Moved to the `yielab` organization** — all repository URLs, badges, clone
  instructions, and the GitHub import user-agent now point at
  `github.com/yielab/tack`.

### Security

- Bumped **undici 7.27.2 → 7.28.0** (transitive via the `jsdom` test dependency)
  to clear a high-severity npm audit advisory (TLS certificate-validation bypass
  and shared-cache information disclosure).
- Scrubbed personal contact details from the repository and git history ahead of
  going public; security contact is now `info@yielab.com`.

---

## [0.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-06-13

Quality, accessibility, and test-infrastructure release. No user-facing feature
changes; focus is on launch readiness.

### Added

- **End-to-end test suite** (`frontend/e2e/`, Playwright): cross-browser
  (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit) smoke tests across every view, user-journey tests,
  WCAG 2.0/2.1 A & AA accessibility scans (axe-core), and API wire-contract
  checks. The harness starts an isolated API (dedicated port + throwaway
  `e2e.db`) and the SPA itself — run with `make e2e`.
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** — `cargo audit` (`.cargo/audit.toml` for
  justified exceptions) + `npm audit`, wired into CI and `make audit`. Weekly
  Dependabot updates for cargo, npm, and GitHub Actions.
- **Load/performance baseline** — k6 script in `tests/load/` (`make load`).
- New CI jobs: `security` and `e2e`. New Makefile targets: `e2e`, `e2e-install`,
  `e2e-ui`, `audit`, `load`.

### Fixed

- Accessibility: darkened `--color-text-tertiary` and `--color-warning-700`
  tokens to meet WCAG AA 4.5:1 contrast; added an `aria-label` to the sidebar
  project selector. Light-theme a11y scans now pass with no suppressions.
- Unknown routes now render a proper 404 page instead of a blank screen.
- API client unwraps the `GET /api/items/{id}` `{ item, roles, dependencies }`
  envelope, fixing an "undefined" title in the item-detail drawer.

### Changed

- Upgraded `object_store` 0.11 → 0.13.2 (uses the new `ObjectStoreExt` API in
  the remote-backup module). No behavior change.

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-06-12

**First public release (beta).** Everything below this point — including the
version numbers 1.x and 2.x — was internal development that was never
published. Public versioning starts here at 0.1.0-beta.1 and will reach
1.0.0 when the app is considered stable.

### Phase 12 — Linear import

- `POST /api/projects/{id}/import-linear` — fetches issues from Linear's GraphQL API
- Accepts a Linear API key, optional team (slug or ID) or project filter, label filter, completed-issue toggle
- Priority mapping: Urgent→Critical, High→High, Medium→Medium, Low→Low
- Cursor-based pagination (50 issues per page)
- 6 unit tests for filter generation, cursor sanitisation, and priority mapping

### Phase 11 — GitHub Issues import

- `POST /api/projects/{id}/import-github` — fetches issues from any public or token-accessible GitHub repository
- Accepts `owner/repo`, full GitHub URL, optional PAT, label filter, closed-issue toggle
- Pull requests are skipped automatically; closed issues land in first Done status; open issues in first workflow status
- Handles pagination (100 issues per page)
- 7 unit tests for URL/input parsing

### Phase 10 — Outbound webhook notifications

- `TACK_WEBHOOK_URL` — POST events to any HTTP endpoint on item and sprint changes
- Events: `item.created`, `item.updated`, `item.deleted`, `sprint.started`, `sprint.completed`, `item.due_soon` (hourly background check)
- Optional HMAC-SHA256 payload signing via `TACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (`X-Tack-Signature: sha256=<hex>`)
- Delivery is fire-and-forget — errors are logged, never surfaced to API callers
- `WebhookClient` in `crates/tack-api/src/webhook.rs`

### Phase 9 — Full integration test coverage

- API handler tests expanded from 16 to 36: added sprints, roles, comments, dependencies, search, JSON/CSV export, item update/delete, board filter-by-type
- Alexa endpoint test suite: 17 tests covering all intents, locale detection, auth rejection, WIP-limit enforcement
- Frontend utility tests: 144 Vitest unit tests across 21 files — API client contracts, `deriveBoard`, context providers, vocab resolution, settings panels, keyboard manager, optimistic rollback
- Pre-push hook added: `.githooks/pre-push` runs `cargo fmt --all --check` + `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` before every push; activate with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

### Release engineering

- Tag-triggered GitHub release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): pushing `vX.Y.Z` builds the embedded-SPA server + CLI for Linux (musl, static), macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), and Windows, and attaches the archives to a GitHub Release with generated notes
- Each archive ships `tack-api` (server with embedded UI), `tack` (CLI), LICENSE, README, and a QUICKSTART.txt for non-developers
- Startup banner now prints the URL to open (`http://localhost:3210`) on plain stdout, independent of log configuration
- Workspace, frontend, and tag versions unified at 0.1.0-beta.1 for the first public beta

### Tests

- **Rust total:** 170 passing + 1 `#[ignore]` perf test (`cargo test --workspace`)
- **Frontend:** 144 Vitest unit tests (21 files)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-08

### Architectural correctness, CLI excellence, and release readiness

Phases 2–4 of the engineering roadmap. Covers architectural cleanup,
a fully-working CLI, vocabulary/workflow UI, performance improvements,
and release-readiness tooling.

### Breaking changes

- `GET /api/projects/{id}/board` removed — replaced by `GET /api/boards/{id}/view`
  (multi-board system, migration 014 back-fills a default board for every project)
- `GET /api/projects/{id}/board/live` WebSocket moved to `GET /api/projects/{id}/boards/live`
- `tack-cli` no longer opens SQLite directly; all commands go through the HTTP API
- `/api/health` response shape changed: removed `"service"` field, added `"migrations_applied"`

### Added

#### Backup & restore (T-401)

- `GET /api/backup` — WAL checkpoint + `VACUUM INTO` temp file, streamed as `application/octet-stream`
- `POST /api/restore` — validates SQLite magic bytes, writes `<db>.restore` next to the live file; applied automatically on next server start (old DB saved as `.bak`)
- `tack backup [path]` and `tack restore <path>` CLI commands
- `get_bytes` / `post_bytes` helpers on `TackClient`

#### Observability (T-402)

- `/api/health` now returns `{"status":"ok","version":"…","migrations_applied":N}`
- `#[instrument(skip(state))]` added to all remaining un-instrumented handlers (`debug_info`, `db_stats`, `board_live`)

#### Single-binary packaging (T-403)

- `--features embed-spa` on `tack-api` embeds the pre-built SPA at compile time via `rust-embed`; `serve_spa` fallback handler serves exact-path assets or falls back to `index.html` for client-side routes
- API routes at `/api/*` always take priority over the SPA fallback
- Dedicated `embed-spa` CI job builds frontend, runs clippy + tests with feature, builds release binary, reports size (~5.2 MB)

#### CLI excellence (T-301)

- `sprint` subcommands: `create`, `start`, `review`, `close`, `list`
- `--json` flag on every command for machine-readable output
- `tack config [--url] [--token] [--show]` — reads/writes `~/.tackrc`
- `tack completions <bash|zsh|fish|…>` via `clap_complete`
- Vocabulary-aware output on `list` and `board` (translates terms per project vocab)

#### Vocabulary + workflow UI (T-302)

- `frontend/src/lib/vocab.ts` — central resolver (`resolveLabel`, `getItemTypeList`) for all 16 vocab keys with default fallbacks
- Settings panel at `/projects/:id/settings` — live table editor for all vocabulary keys and workflow status columns (add/remove/rename, set category and WIP limit)
- All UI labels route through the vocab resolver; no hardcoded "Task"/"Sprint" strings

#### Assignee field (T-205)

- `assignee: Option<String>` on `Item`, `CreateItem`, `UpdateItem`, `ItemFilter`
- Migration 015 adds `assignee TEXT` column with an index
- Board `Assignee` grouping now works (null → "Unassigned" lane)
- Assignee input in `CreateItemModal`; filter column in `List` view

#### Import (T-204)

- `POST /api/projects/import` fully implemented with two-pass item creation (parent_ids wired after all items exist), sprint ID remapping, dependency remapping, and rollback on failure

#### Performance (T-303)

- Migration 016 adds `idx_items_sprint ON items(project_id, sprint_id)`
- `#[ignore]` perf test seeds 50k items and asserts `list_items` p95 < 100 ms
- Lazy route loading in frontend drops entry bundle from ~53 KB to 22 KB gzipped
- CI gate: entry bundle (index + routing chunks) must stay under 30 KB gzipped

### Changed

- **Workflow validation moved to `tack-core`** (T-201): `validate_transition`,
  `check_wip_limit`, `find_first_done_status`, `should_complete_parent` are now
  pure functions in `tack-core::workflow`; handlers are thin transports
- **Dual board system removed** (T-202): `board_views` table dropped (migration 014),
  legacy `handlers/board.rs` removed, WebSocket endpoint consolidated under boards
- **CLI rewritten** (T-203): `tack-cli` now uses `reqwest` blocking HTTP client;
  `sqlx` and `tack-db` dependencies removed from CLI crate; `~/.tackrc` config
- `cargo clippy --all-features` replaced with `cargo clippy --all-targets` in the
  main CI job (embed-spa feature requires a pre-built frontend, tested separately)

### Fixed

- Pre-existing `collapsible_if` lint errors resolved via Rust let-chains across
  `dependency.rs`, `workflow.rs`, `config.rs`, `export.rs`, `items.rs`
- `redundant_closure` in `items.rs` (`.map_err(ApiError::Core)`)
- `dead_code` warnings on test helpers in `tack-db/tests/common/mod.rs`
- `empty_line_after_doc_comments` in `debug.rs`
- `test_app_with_config` helper now overrides `database_url` to `sqlite::memory:`
  so config and pool are consistent

### Test results

- Total: **92 passing** + 1 `#[ignore]` perf test (`cargo test --workspace`)
- With `--features embed-spa`: **95 tests**
- New tests: workflow unit tests (transitions, WIP, parent-complete), DB integration
  (assignee filter, board management, import round-trip), API handler tests
  (backup/restore, health shape, SPA serving), CLI tests (config, vocab, completions)
