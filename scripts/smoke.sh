# End-to-end smoke: a real `tack serve` + a real `tack-runner` + harness binaries.
#
# Steps 1-6 build the fixture; what steps 7-14 each prove:
#
#   7  claim -> checkout -> harness -> completion, through production routes
#   8  the same neutral request through each harness kind, reported per kind
#   9  restart recovery: kill the runner mid-attempt, prove no silent loss and
#      no blind duplicate execution, then an explicit operator requeue
#   10 standalone mode: `tack serve --with-runner` alone reaches a completed
#      attempt, with no separate runner process and no operator-issued token
#   11 default `tack serve` (no flag) starts no runner, checked against the
#      live fleet endpoint rather than inferred from a log line
#   12 a non-loopback bind refuses `--with-runner` before any listener opens
#   13 the gateway path: a local fake Vercel-shaped HTTP shim proves key ->
#      catalog -> spawn environment -> actual model, and that a wrong key
#      is rejected end to end (catalog check and live dispatch both)
#   14 GET /api/local-runner/secrets is a genuine 404 on a non-loopback
#      bind — never merely refused, never present on any other bind mode
#
#   ./scripts/smoke.sh            # fake mode: shim harness binaries (free, deterministic)
#   ./scripts/smoke.sh --live     # real harness binaries — a real model run happens
#
# Fake mode drives the FULL production pipeline (server, scheduler, runner,
# provisioner, adapter, subprocess); only the harness *binary* is a shim. Step 9
# uses the shim in both modes: restart mechanics are harness-agnostic and a kill
# test must not burn a billed run.
#
# The exit code reports step integrity: 0 = every runnable step held, 1 = a step
# failed. A step that CANNOT pass because the product cannot do the thing is a
# FAIL, never a SKIP — that is the false green this file shipped once already.
# Environmental absence (a harness binary not installed) is reported as ABSENT
# and listed in the release verdict, never rounded up and never counted as PASS.

step 14 "GET /api/local-runner/secrets is a genuine 404 on a non-loopback bind"
# It is tempting to assume plain 'tack serve' (no --with-runner) leaves this
# route unmounted; measured directly against this build and found false: ADR
# 0061 decision 6 (crates/tack-cli/src/local_runner.rs::serve's own doc
# comment) wires an EmbeddedRunnerControl into every 'tack serve', with or
# without --with-runner, so the UI toggle can turn the runner on later with
# no restart — router.rs only gates these routes on
# `state.local_runner.is_some() && state.config.binds_loopback()`. The real,
# current 404 boundary is bind mode, confirmed live below and already
# unit-tested server-side (routes_are_absent_on_a_non_loopback_bind/
# routes_are_absent_on_a_loopback_bind_with_no_control). This step proves the
# boundary end to end against the real binary instead of repeating the stale
# premise.
