# Records the durable-recovery demo (docs/screenshots/recovery-demo.gif) from a
# real GitHub Release artifact, not from a development build.
#
# What runs where (read this before changing the topology):
#   - The board (`tack serve`) and the runner (`tack-runner`) are the published
#     release binaries, downloaded straight from GitHub and run inside two
#     disposable Docker containers that never see this repository's source.
#   - The browser that drives and records the UI (Playwright, from
#     frontend/e2e/recovery-demo.spec.ts) runs from this checkout, because the
#     recorder has to be something; it is not part of what is being proven.
#     Everything the recording shows happening on the board/runner side comes
#     from the release artifact alone.
#   - The "harness" (the coding agent Codex/Claude Code would normally spawn)
#     is a tiny stand-in shell script generated below, not a real model call.
#     It plays exactly the role scripts/smoke.sh's own shim plays: something
#     deterministic to kill mid-run, so the recording doesn't depend on a
#     live, billed model finishing at an unpredictable time. It is dev
#     tooling, like the shim itself, never shipped in the release.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/record-recovery-demo.sh                  # uses TACK_DEMO_VERSION below
#   TACK_DEMO_VERSION=v0.1.0-beta.9 ./scripts/record-recovery-demo.sh
#
# Requires: docker, curl, jq, git, node/npm (frontend deps installed), ffmpeg.
