# Resolves every URL the docs advertise as a way to get tack, and fails if any
# of them doesn't come back with a 2xx. This is the only thing in the repo
# that would have caught the install one-liner pointing at a branch that
# didn't exist — nothing else touches these files together.
#
# Resolving a URL is not installing from it: a release can publish two
# archives that share the same platform suffix, the GitHub releases API can
# list the wrong one first, and install.sh's asset picker can grab it —
# every advertised URL still returns 2xx while the install itself fails.
# So after the URL sweep, this script actually runs the repository's
# install.sh against whatever release is really published, into a scratch
# directory, and asserts a genuine, runnable `tack` binary lands.
#
# Run from the repository root: scripts/verify-install-urls.sh
#
# If a new page starts advertising an install command, add its path to FILES.
