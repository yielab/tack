// `webServer` block below, so `npm run test:e2e` is the only command needed.
//
// The API runs against a throwaway SQLite file (e2e.db) and storage dir so a
// run never touches your working database. "Throwaway" is enforced, not just
// named: the API webServer's own `command` below deletes both before it starts
// `cargo run`, so a fresh invocation of this suite always starts from an empty
// database and an empty storage dir, never whatever the previous run left
// behind. The deletion runs inside the process Playwright spawns, strictly
// before that process opens the database — never as a separate step racing a
// server that might already be reading it. When `reuseExistingServer` finds a
// server already up (the local, non-CI default), the command never runs and
// that server's existing database is reused untouched — the developer already
// chose persistence by leaving that server running. See docs/TESTING.md's
// E2E section for the measured cost of resetting every run.

// Fake `claude`/`codex` binaries (`e2e/fixtures/harness-shims/`), prepended
// ahead of the real PATH so the embedded runner's own probe (a real
// subprocess exec — see `agents-page.spec.ts`) always finds these instead
// of whatever is or isn't really installed on the machine running the
// suite. Prepending rather than replacing keeps `cargo`/`node` resolvable
// via whatever the rest of PATH already is, on any machine or CI runner.

      // history calls out as its own bug class). `e2e.db*` (not a fixed
