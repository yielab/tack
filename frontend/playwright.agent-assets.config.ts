// Deliberately has NO webServer block, the same reasoning
// playwright.recovery-demo.config.ts documents: the target here is an
// already-running `tack serve --with-runner` RELEASE build (with the
// `embed-spa` feature, real installed `claude`/`codex` binaries on PATH,
// TACK_PORT=3311, a database/state dir inside this worktree) — never the
// dev `cargo run`/`npm run dev` pair the default config starts, and never
// the fake harness-shims PATH override `playwright.capture.config.ts`
// inherits from it. Every attempt this suite drives is a real, live, billed
// model call — that is the whole point of the card these assets are for.
