 * `harness_kind` is an opaque string (`HarnessKind::Other(String)` on the

 *
 * Worth calling out explicitly: `crates/tack-cli/src/execution.rs`'s own
 * unit tests use `"claude_code"` (an UNDERSCORE) as an arbitrary example
 * value for what is, on the wire, an untyped `String` field
 * (`CreateExecution::requested_harness_kind`) — that is a test fixture
 * string, not the runner's real reported `harness_kind`. Copying the
 * underscore form here would silently make Claude Code unselectable against
 * any runner that actually reports itself as `"claude-code"`, since matching
 * against a real runner's capability report is a byte-exact string compare
 * (`capabilities.ts#isCombinationSupported`). Verified by reading the

 * none does" — both send the identical null/null pair over the wire, and
 * the difference is entirely server-side state this function has to read
 * from the same data the modal already fetches for other fields. Mirrors
 * `crates/tack-orch/src/model_policy/mod.rs`'s `resolve_model_policy`
 * precedence walk (agent profile → project → fleet; request override is
 * never present here, since this is only computed for an Auto selection)
 * applied to the same three tiers `wiring.rs`'s
 * `resolve_request_model_policy` reads at request time — the request's own
 * agent profile, its item's project, and (only when the target IS a fleet)
 * that fleet.
 *
 * `outcome: 'pinned_auto'` is `mod.rs`'s documented nuance that a tier
 * explicitly set to the literal `"auto"` is a real, present value that
 * *stops* the walk at that tier rather than falling through to a
 * less-specific tier that might name a concrete model — so a fleet or
 * agent-profile default beneath it never gets a chance to rescue the
 * request, exactly like the server.
 *
 * This is a hand-written copy of three specific Rust decisions —
 * `ModelPolicyTier::ORDER`'s precedence, `resolve_model_policy`'s walk over
 * it, and `parse_model_default_convention`'s parsing of the `limits`/
 * `default_policy` blobs — not a shared definition. Nothing on either side
 * fails to build or fails a test if they drift apart. Because
 * `gateHarnessModelSelection` now blocks a dispatch on this function's
 * answer instead of only commenting on it, the practical risk runs one
 * direction: this copy falling behind a Rust-side change that would resolve
 * *more* requests (an added tier, a reordered precedence, a convention
 * parsed more leniently) reads as `'unresolved'`/`'pinned_auto'` here after
 * the server would already schedule the same request fine — a dialog that
 * confidently refuses a dispatch that would have worked, not one that lets
 * through a dispatch that won't. That asymmetry follows from
 * `parse_model_default_convention`'s own stated posture (an unrecognised
 * shape reads as "no opinion", never an error) — tightening that posture
 * later, the one change that would point the risk the other way, would be
 * a deliberate, visible break from how it already documents itself, not a
