// Pure, framework-agnostic display logic for one attempt's model provenance
// and usage economics (TODO.md III-F4: "model provenance, honest
// usage/economics"). Kept separate from `AttemptList.tsx` for the same
// reason `shared.ts` is separate from `RunWithAgentModal.tsx` — unit
// testable without mounting anything, and a single place every consumer
// (`AttemptList.tsx`, its tests) reads through so "Not measured" can never
// silently drift into "$0.00" at a second call site.
//
// **The load-bearing rule this whole file exists to enforce (CLAUDE.md rule
// 1 / III.2 rule 7):** `usage_economics.runner_time_cost.cost_usd_estimated`
// is `{value: null, source: "not_measured"}` in *every real response this
// API returns today* — no runner infra cost-rate is stored anywhere in this
// schema (III-F3 handoff, "Schema/API/contract change requested" item 2).
// `formatUsdMeasurement` below renders that literal, unmistakable text
// `"Not measured"` — never `$0.00`, `—`, `0`, or a blank cell, which would
// each be a lie about real money. `absent_usage_never_serializes_as_zero`
// (`crates/tack-orch/src/usage_provenance.rs`) is the backend half of this
// same guarantee; this file is the frontend half.
