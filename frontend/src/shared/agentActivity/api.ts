// Wire-format boundary for per-item agent activity (the item-detail "Agent
// Activity" tab, and the badge chip shown on Board/List/Table).
//
// Card B6 (2026-08-05) implemented both endpoints below
// (`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/orch.rs`'s `get_item_agent_activity` /
// `get_project_agent_activity`) and reconciled them against this file
// field-for-field, matching A4's precedent for the Fleet view exactly —
// **zero changes to any component that consumes these types**
// (`AgentActivityTab.tsx`, `AgentStateChip.tsx`, `format.ts`, the Board/
// List/Table call sites). Every type below, and the two open questions this
// header used to flag, are now confirmed against the real handler rather
// than assumed:
//
//  1. "Latest attempt" tie-break (bulk badge endpoint): highest `attempt`
//     number wins; ties broken by `dispatched_at` desc — exactly the
//     assumption this comment originally documented.
//  2. Inner join, not a left join with an explicit null state — an item
//     with no `orch_tasks` row has no row in `AgentBadgeResponse.rows`,
//     which is what `useAgentActivityMap` already treats as "no badge."
//
// The only wire additions beyond what this file originally assumed:
// `ItemAgentActivity.events_truncated` / `.events_retention_days` (see their
// own doc comments below) — additive, so this reconciliation really did
// touch only this file, not the component tree. `AgentActivityTab.tsx`
// doesn't render them yet; that's a follow-up, not a blocker, since
// `events` is empty until B2's trace ingestion lands regardless.
//
// Field provenance — every field here is a snake_case projection of a real
// column, not an invention:
//
//  1. `crates/tack-db/src/migrations.rs`:
//     - migration 021 `orch_tasks` (PK `(item_id, remote_task_id)`):
//       `remote_task_id, remote_run_id, remote_status, attempt, tokens_in,
//       tokens_out, cost_usd_estimated, dispatched_at`. `trusted` (untrusted
//       auto-dispatch flag, Phase 35/C2 concept) exists on the table but is
//       deliberately NOT surfaced here — there's no UI story for it yet
//       (no auto-dispatch feature has landed), so exposing it now would just
//       be a field nobody reads. Flagging as a gap for whoever builds C2.
//     - migration 022 `orch_runs`: `run_id, source, state, started_at,
//       ended_at, error` (via `orch_tasks.remote_run_id`, not a hard FK —
//       see the migration's own comment on why).
//     - migration 023 `orch_events`: `id, event_type, payload, occurred_at`
//       — this table is currently ALWAYS EMPTY: ingestion is card B2 (Trace
//       ingestion, 34.4), which is blocked on a docket endpoint that doesn't
//       exist yet (`GET /traces/{project}`, see TODO.md §Wave 2 card B2).
//       The `events` field is still modeled and rendered now so that when B2
//       ships, populating it is a pure backend change — no frontend diff.
//     - migration 024 `orch_approvals`: `token, remote_task_id, agent,
//       action, state, requested_at, decided_at`.
//  2. `crates/tack-orch/src/lib.rs` (frozen by W0-A) — the wire *values* for
//     the state fields come from `TaskStatus` (orch_tasks.remote_status:
//     pending|running|done|failed|blocked|waiting_approval), `RunState`
//     (orch_runs.state: queued|running|succeeded|failed|cancelled), and
//     `ApprovalState` (orch_approvals.state: pending|granted|denied). Every
//     one of these carries an `Unknown(String)` fallback on the Rust side
//     (TODO.md §1.2: "a docket upgrade that adds a state must degrade to
//     'shown as-is', never a deserialization error") — so every string field
//     below is typed as a plain `string`, not a TS union, and rendering code
//     must handle an unrecognised value by showing it verbatim rather than
//     assuming it's one of the known set. `deriveAgentChipState` in
//     `./format.ts` is where that degradation happens for the chip.
//
// Two endpoints, two shapes:
//
//  - `GET /items/{id}/agent-activity` — full detail for the item-detail tab.
//    One row per `orch_tasks` attempt for this item, each carrying its
//    correlated run (if `remote_run_id` resolves) and events (empty until
//    B2), plus every `orch_approvals` row for this item (both pending and
//    decided — the tab is a history view, not just a pending-inbox).
//  - `GET /projects/{id}/agent-activity` — the bulk shape Board/List/Table
//    need for badges: one row per item *that has at least one `orch_tasks`
//    row* (an inner join, not a left join with nulls) — an item with no
//    agent activity simply has no row, which is how the chip knows to render
//    nothing (TODO.md card B5's acceptance: "an item with no agent activity
//    shows no chip"). Each row carries only the latest attempt's raw
//    `remote_status` — same reasoning as 34.9's "compact state chip ... driven
//    by the orch_tasks LEFT JOIN" wording, projected down to what a badge
//    needs. "Latest attempt" means the row with the highest `attempt` number
//    (ties broken by `dispatched_at` desc), not e.g. "any non-terminal
//    attempt wins" — confirmed against `list_latest_orch_task_status_for_project`
//    in `crates/tack-db/src/repo/orch.rs` (card B6).
