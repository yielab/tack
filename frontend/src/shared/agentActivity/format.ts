 * Collapses the wire's `TaskStatus` (pending | running | done | failed |
 * blocked | waiting_approval | an unrecognised `Unknown(String)` value — see
 * `./api.ts`'s header comment) down to the chip's 5 visually distinct
 * states.
 *
 * Two states fold into `failed` rather than getting a 6th slot of their own,
 * both deliberate, both flagged here for whoever next touches this:
 *
 *  - `blocked` → `failed`. It has no distinct slot of its own among the
 *    five, and semantically "the agent cannot proceed without intervention"
 *    reads as "needs attention" — the same signal `failed` already carries.
 *    A future change that wants `blocked` to read differently (e.g. it's
 *    not actually an error, just paused) should give it its own
 *    `AgentChipState` member and a 6th tone.
 *  - Any unrecognised value → `failed`. This is the conservative direction:
 *    showing an unfamiliar status as "queued" or "done" risks hiding a real
 *    problem, whereas flagging an unknown status as "needs a look" costs
 *    nothing when it turns out to be fine. Mirrors the Rust side's own
 *    philosophy of never erroring on an unknown value, just choosing the
 *    safe rendering.
 *
 * `done` earns the fifth slot (rather than giving `blocked` its own) because
 * a completed dispatch is exactly the kind of at-a-glance signal this chip
 * exists for.
