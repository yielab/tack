/**
 * The one place a `CapabilityGate` becomes visible copy. Renders nothing
 * while the gate is enabled; once disabled, always shows the reason
 * **verbatim from the capability payload** — never a string this component
 * invents. This is the concrete answer to TODO.md §II.0 rule 6
 * ("a capability is a value, never a provider check") for read-only/
 * informational controls: `features/fleet/FleetRow.tsx` and
 * `features/settings/orchestrationSettings/ControlPlanesManager.tsx` both
 * use this instead of writing their own copy, so there is exactly one place
 * that could regress into a hard-coded string.
 *
 * Deliberately a plain note, not a disabled `<button>`: no pause/resume
 * *action* exists on the wire yet (that lands with the Wave C trait
 * reshape), and rendering an inert button that looks clickable would be a
 * worse failure than rendering none — see the plan's own framing, "the UI
 * disables what a provider cannot do and names why," which a note satisfies
 * without implying an affordance that isn't there yet.
