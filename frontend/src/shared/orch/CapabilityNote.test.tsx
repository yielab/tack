 * the control being disabled. A component that special-cased the plane's
 * `kind` string to decide whether to render, or that hard-coded its own
 * "not supported" copy, would also make the control disabled — this test
 * only passes if the rendered text actually traces back to the payload's
 * own `reason` field, proven by swapping in two DIFFERENT payload reasons
 * and asserting each one's exact text appears.
