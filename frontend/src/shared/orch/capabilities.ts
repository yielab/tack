// Wire-format boundary for `tack_orch::Capabilities` (card G1, backend half) —
// what a registered control plane can actually do, surfaced on
// `GET /api/control-planes/{id}` (`ControlPlaneResponse.capabilities`) and
// `GET /api/fleet` (`FleetEntry.capabilities`). Every field here is a
// snake_case projection of `crates/tack-api/src/handlers/orch.rs`'s
// `CapabilitiesResponse` and its five `*Level` enums — not a guess; the enum
// string values are pinned in `docs/openapi.json`.
//
// This is the whole point of TODO.md §II.0 rule 6 ("a capability is a value,
// never a provider check") and the mechanism §II.1.2 describes: every
// non-boolean field carries a `reason: string` written by the *adapter*
// (docket, or later GitHub Actions), never invented by this API layer or by
// a component. A component that wants to know whether a control should be
// interactive, and what to say when it isn't, imports {@link gate} (or one
// of the named per-field helpers below) from this file — never a hard-coded
// string, and never an equality check against a plane's `kind` string (the
// grep this repo's CI runs to catch a regression stays at zero hits).
//
// Two ad-hoc capability bits predate this module and are retired in favour
// of it (TODO.md card G1, item 3): the approvals inbox's old
// grant-availability boolean (`features/approvals/api.ts` — see that file's
// header for why its replacement isn't literally a `Capabilities` read: it
// was never a provider capability, it was a Tack-server auth gate) and
// `useAgentActivityMap`'s `orchAvailable()` used as a dispatch gate (see
// that file's doc comment for the residual wiring gap this card found but
// could not close without editing a file outside its ownership).
