// Domain vocabulary for the runner-fleet execution surface.
//
// **Why this is hand-written and not imported from `../api/schema.gen`:**
// every operator execution/fleet/runner/profile route
// (`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/executions.rs`,
// `crates/tack-api/src/handlers/runner_admin.rs`, wired in
// `crates/tack-api/src/router.rs`) now publishes a real, generated OpenAPI
// schema for its request/response bodies — but this file's shapes were
// written before that existed and were never migrated to import the
// generated types: matching each field to its generated equivalent across
// every consumer in this domain is a larger refactor, not done here. Every
// shape below is instead copied field-for-field from the real Rust source,
// cited per type. This file is the ONE place that mirrors those shapes;
// nothing downstream may redeclare a competing copy.
//
// A second, independent source grounds the richer domain concepts
// (`ExecutionState`, `RunnerSelector`, capability snapshots, usage
// provenance) that the current thin operator GET responses don't yet expose
// at all: `crates/tack-orch/src/execution/{types,capabilities}.rs` (the
// runner-v1 protocol's own Rust types) and the frozen fixtures under
// `docs/contracts/runner-v1/` (the language-neutral authority for that
// protocol). Those fixtures describe the runner<->API protocol, not the
// browser-facing operator API — but they are the only real, versioned
// description of this vocabulary that exists anywhere in the repo, and the
// operator surface is defined to carry the same values (e.g.
// `execution_requests.state` and `execution_attempts.state` are the same
// column values the runner protocol negotiates). Modeling them here means
// a richer UI has a stable type to code against once a read endpoint for
// it lands, instead of a second reconciliation later.
