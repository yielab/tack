// Wire-format boundary for the per-request attempt/event surface (TODO.md
// III-F4): `GET /executions/{id}/attempts` and `GET
// /executions/{id}/attempts/{attempt_number}/events`. Both routes were added
// by card III-E6 (`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/executions.rs`,
// `list_execution_attempts`/`list_execution_attempt_events`) but deliberately
// left unwired on the frontend — see that card's own handoff, "Schema/API/
// contract change requested from another owner" item 5: "wiring them in is
// now purely mechanical ... A natural F4 task." This file is that wiring's
// wire-format layer; `store.ts#loadAttempts`/`attemptsFor` is the reactive
// layer built on top of it.
//
// Every shape below is copied field-for-field from the real handler
// (`AttemptSummary`/`AttemptListResponse`/`EventSummary`/`EventListResponse`
// in `executions.rs`), the same hand-typed-from-Rust convention `api.ts`'s
// header comment already documents for this whole domain (still true today —
// this domain's OpenAPI schemas type `model_provenance`/`usage_economics` via
// `#[schema(value_type = ...)]` mirrors defined in `executions.rs` itself,
// not surfaced as reusable named schemas in `schema.gen.ts`).
//
// `model_provenance` (nullable — `null` until the attempt reports
// `actual_execution`) and `usage_economics` (always present) were added to
// `AttemptSummary` by the Wave 5 integrator (III-F6b/III-F6e), wiring III-F3's
// pure `tack_orch::usage_provenance` resolution into this handler. Both are
// typed here from `tack_orch::usage_provenance::{ModelProvenance,
// UsageEconomics, RunnerTimeCost}` (via `executions.rs`'s own
// `ModelProvenanceSchema`/`UsageEconomicsSchema`/`RunnerTimeCostSchema`
// OpenAPI mirrors, which this file matches byte-for-byte).
