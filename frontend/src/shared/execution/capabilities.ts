// Pure capability-selector logic: what harness/provider/model combinations
// are actually usable, driven by real runner-reported capability data, not
// assumptions.
//
// Every function here takes `RunnerCapabilities[]` (see `types.ts`) as a
// plain argument — it performs no I/O and knows nothing about HTTP, caching,
// or where the snapshots came from, the same "pure selection, never grants
// the authoritative lease" split `crates/tack-orch/src/scheduler` draws
// server-side, applied to the frontend's read-side equivalent: a component
// decides whether to let an operator pick a harness/provider/model
// combination, never whether to actually grant a lease.
//
// `GET /runners` feeds these functions today via `RunWithAgentModal.tsx`'s
// `runnerSummaryToCapabilities` adapter (see `types.ts`'s `RunnerCapabilities`
// doc comment) — every function below is tested against the frozen
// `docs/contracts/runner-v1/capabilities.json` fixture shape.
//
// No function in this file ever reports `supported: true` without at least
// one runner's real capability data backing it, and never reports
// `supported: false` without a specific, typed reason — unsupported is
// typed, unknown is explicit, extended to this module's own vocabulary: an
// empty snapshot list is `false` with the explicit reason `'no runner
// capability data available'`, never a structural zero indistinguishable
// from "checked, and it's unsupported."
