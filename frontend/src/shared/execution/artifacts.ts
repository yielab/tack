// Wire-format boundary for verified artifact download (TODO.md III-F4):
// `GET /executions/{request_id}/attempts/{attempt_number}/artifacts/
// {artifact_id}/content` — mounted in production by the Wave 5 integrator
// (III-F6/F6a) at `crates/tack-api/src/handlers/runner_protocol/
// artifact_download.rs`, proven through the real router by
// `crates/tack-api/tests/f6a_artifact_wiring_test.rs`.
//
// `artifactsApi.list` calls the discovery route this card adds — `GET
// /executions/{request_id}/attempts/{attempt_number}/artifacts`
// (`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/attempt_lists.rs`), returning every
// manifest recorded for that attempt, oldest first — `artifact_id` is no
// longer something an operator has to already know.
//
// Two HTTP outcomes from `download` distinguish two genuinely different
// server states, per this card's acceptance bar ("artifact failure
// visible") and III.2 rule 7 ("unmeasured is nullable" applied to presence,
// not just numbers):
//   - `404 not_found` — no artifact manifest exists under this id at all.
//   - `409 conflict` — the manifest exists, but its content has not been
//     verified (streamed + checksummed) yet; genuinely different from
//     "gone", per `artifact_download.rs`'s own doc comment. `list`'s own
//     `content_verified` field reports this same fact ahead of a download
//     attempt, from the same manifest row.
