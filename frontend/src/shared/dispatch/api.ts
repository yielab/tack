// Wire-format boundary for dispatching work to an agent fleet (TODO.md Wave
// 3, card C4, tasks 35.8/35.9). Every assumption about request/response
// shapes lives in this one file, plus `./format.ts` for interpreting them —
// consuming components (`ItemDetailDrawer.tsx`, `Board.tsx`'s `ItemCard`
// menu, `features/sprints/DispatchSprintModal.tsx`) only ever import types
// and functions from here, never construct a request body or read a raw
// field name themselves. Mirrors the pattern A5 set for `features/fleet/
// api.ts` and B5 repeated for `shared/agentActivity/api.ts` — "when the real
// endpoint lands (or changes), reconcile against this file only."
//
// Two endpoints, two very different confidence levels:
//
//  1. `POST /items/{id}/dispatch` — built by card C1, landed *before* this
//     card started, and confirmed field-for-field against
//     `docs/openapi.json`'s `DispatchItemResponse`/`DispatchedTaskResponse`
//     schemas (themselves generated from the real Rust handler in
//     `crates/tack-api/src/handlers/orch.rs`) plus card R1's later addition
//     of the typed `policy_id` field. This is NOT a guess — every field name
//     and nullability below is copied from the generated schema.
//
//  2. `POST /sprints/{id}/dispatch` and `GET /sprints/{id}/dispatch/dry-run`
//     — card C3 landed these *after* this file's first draft (written
//     against a best guess while C3 was still in progress). Reconciled
//     2026-08-05 against `docs/openapi.json`'s `SprintDispatchItemResponse`/
//     `SprintDispatchSummary`/`DryRunSprintDispatchResponse`/
//     `SprintDispatchResponse` schemas and C3's own handoff note (TODO.md §6
//     "C3 — 2026-08-05", which includes a field-by-field diff against this
//     file's original guess) — every field below is the real, generated
//     contract, not a guess. Three things the original guess got wrong,
//     worth remembering because they'd otherwise fail silently: (1)
//     `max_in_flight` is a **query parameter** on both routes, not a JSON
//     body field — a body was never read by the handler, so sending it there
//     silently did nothing; (2) every sprint item is **always** present with
//     an `order` — nothing is filtered out of the plan the way a nullable
//     "position" implied; (3) eligibility is a **closed vocabulary**
//     (`decision`), not free text, and dry-run vs. a real run share the same
//     shape with different possible `decision` values (`would_dispatch` only
//     appears in a dry run; `dispatched`/`blocked`/`waiting_approval`/`error`
//     only appear in a real run).
