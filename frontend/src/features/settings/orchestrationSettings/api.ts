// Wire-format boundary for the app-level Settings → Orchestration page
// (TODO.md Phase 39, card E2 — "make the agent-factory control center
// discoverable"). Every assumption about `GET/PUT /api/settings/orchestration`
// and the `/control-planes` admin CRUD lives in this one file —
// `OrchestrationSettingsSection.tsx`, `ControlPlanesManager.tsx`, and
// `ProjectLinker.tsx` only ever import types and functions from here, never
// construct a request body or read a raw wire field themselves. Mirrors the
// pattern A5 set for `features/fleet/api.ts` and every later feature
// directory repeated (D1's `features/approvals/api.ts`, D2's
// `features/settings/orchestration/api.ts`, D5's `features/economics/api.ts`).
//
// ── The `GET/PUT /api/settings/orchestration` contract ──────────────────────
//
// Frozen by the E1/E2 split before either agent started (E1 builds the Rust
// side — making `TACK_ORCH_ENABLE` runtime-toggleable and DB-backed,
// following the existing Cloud Backup settings precedent
// (`app_meta`/`TACK_BACKUP_*`) — E2, this file, builds everything the
// operator sees). Field-for-field, exactly as specified — do not rename or
// "improve" a field name here without re-syncing with E1's DTO:
//
//   GET  /api/settings/orchestration → 200, reachable even when
//        orchestration is OFF (this is the one orchestration route that must
//        never itself be gated behind the flag it reports on — otherwise an
//        operator could never discover the toggle in the first place).
//   PUT  /api/settings/orchestration  body: { enabled: boolean } → 200, same
//        response shape as the GET.
//
// `source` and `env_default` look redundant at first read but answer two
// different questions: `env_default` is what `TACK_ORCH_ENABLE` is actually
// set to in this process's environment (or `false` if unset); `source` says
// which of that env value or a saved database override is the one currently
// in effect for `enabled`. An operator can save `enabled: false` from the UI
// on a server that has `TACK_ORCH_ENABLE=true` in its environment — `source`
// would then read `"database"` and `enabled` would be `false`, with
// `env_default: true` still telling the operator what the environment alone
// would have produced. `OrchestrationSettingsSection.tsx` surfaces both,
// per the card's explicit instruction ("an operator whose deployment sets
// TACK_ORCH_ENABLE should understand where the value came from").
//
// This endpoint's own fetch failing is NOT treated as "orchestration is
// disabled" the way every other orchestration route is (see
// `shared/api/client.ts#isOrchestrationDisabledError`) — by contract it
// always answers 200. A failure here means either the request genuinely
// couldn't reach the server, or (transiently, while E1's card is still
// landing in the same session) the route doesn't exist yet. Either way the
// section renders a distinct "couldn't load" retry state, never the
// "disabled" empty state the rest of the app uses.
//
// ── Control-plane admin (`/control-planes`) ──────────────────────────────
//
// `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/control-planes(/{id})` already exist —
// card A4 (Wave 1) built them, `crates/tack-api/src/handlers/orch.rs`'s
// `create_control_plane`/`list_control_planes`/`get_control_plane`/
// `update_control_plane`/`delete_control_plane` — but until this card no page
// ever called anything past `GET /control-planes` (D2's `LinkForm.tsx` reads
// the list to populate a picker; its own header note says registering one is
// still a `curl POST /api/control-planes` away). `ControlPlaneDetail` below
// is copied field-for-field from `ControlPlaneResponse`
// (`handlers/orch.rs`) — note there is deliberately no `token` field
// anywhere in a response; the token is write-only, exactly like
// `TACK_BACKUP_SECRET_KEY`/Cloud Backup's `secret_key_set` boolean, mirrored
// here as `token_set`.
//
// Duplicated rather than imported from `features/settings/orchestration/
// api.ts` (D2's per-project panel) even though both live under
// `features/settings/**` (the same top-level `architecture.test.ts` feature,
// so importing across would be legal) — that file's `ControlPlaneOption` is
// deliberately narrow (id/name/kind/health, exactly what a `<select>`
// needs); this page's control-plane *admin* UI needs the fuller
// `ControlPlaneResponse` shape (base_url, token_set, last_seen_at,
// consecutive_failures) to actually manage a plane, not just pick one.
