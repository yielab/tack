// file — `ApprovalsPage.tsx` and `format.ts` only ever import types and
// functions from here, never construct a request body or read a raw field
// name themselves. Mirrors the pattern A5 set for `features/fleet/api.ts`
// and C4 repeated for `shared/dispatch/api.ts`.
//
// Both routes and every field below are copied field-for-field from the real
// Rust handler (`crates/tack-api/src/handlers/orch.rs`'s
// `PendingApprovalResponse`/`PendingApprovalListResponse`/
// `DecideApprovalRequest`/`DecideApprovalResponse`) and `docs/openapi.json`
// — not a guess (unlike A5's original Fleet draft, this file was written
// after the backend landed in the same session).
