// Wire-format boundary for the Fleet view.
//
// `GET /api/fleet` does not exist yet — agent A4 is building it concurrently
// (TODO.md Wave 1, card A4: "Config + control-plane API"). Every assumption
// about the response shape is isolated to this one file: the types below plus
// the single `fleetApi.list()` fetch function. When A4's endpoint lands,
// reconciling the frontend means editing THIS FILE ONLY — never
// `FleetRow.tsx`, `FleetPage.tsx`, `HealthChip.tsx`, or `format.ts`, which all
// consume the `FleetRow` type, not the wire response directly.
//
// Derived from the two frozen sources named in the A5 card (TODO.md §Wave 1):
//
//  1. `crates/tack-orch/src/lib.rs` (frozen by W0-A) — `FleetStatus`,
//     `FleetAgent`, `Health`, mirroring docket's own `/status.json`. See
//     TODO.md §6 "W0-A — 2026-08-04" for the exact frozen field list: a
//     `FleetAgent` carries `id, name, kind, scope, model, registered,
//     bindings, last_activity, cost_usd_estimated ("costUsd" on the wire),
//     budget_usd`.
//  2. `crates/tack-db/src/migrations.rs` migrations 019 (`control_planes`:
//     name, kind, base_url, health, last_seen_at, consecutive_failures,
//     api_version) and 020 (`orch_links`: project_id, control_plane_id,
//     blueprint, auto_dispatch, budget_usd, status_map) — see TODO.md §6
//     "W0-B — 2026-08-04" for final column names.
//
// TODO.md §2 describes `GET /api/fleet` as "the Fleet view's aggregate" — my
// reading is one row per Tack project that has an `orch_links` row, merging:
// the link, its linked `control_planes` row (health, last_seen_at, ...), and
// a snapshot of that plane's live `FleetStatus` (roster, cost, budget). No
// real endpoint exists to verify this against, so `FleetRow` below is a
// best-guess snake_case projection — A4 should treat it as the reconciliation
// target, not a spec to match blindly.
