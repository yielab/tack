// this Provider as a deliberate omission for "whichever card first needs it
// in a component tree" (III-E4). `Layout` itself is the app shell shared by
// every unrelated feature (Projects, Templates, Fleet, Settings, ...), so
// wrapping here — the smallest common ancestor that is NOT that shared
// internals file — keeps this card's footprint to a two-line, purely
// additive wrap instead of editing `Layout.tsx`'s body.
