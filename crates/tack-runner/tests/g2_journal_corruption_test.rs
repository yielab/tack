//! Corrupt-journal adversarial coverage for the local runner
//! journal. This file owns adversarial tests and the audit report only —
//! no production source is touched here.
//!
//! `OwnerOnlyJournal` already has in-module unit tests for a symlinked
//! journal/quarantine directory and a filename that disagrees with its own
//! record (`journal.rs`'s own test module). This file targets a case
//! neither covers: a journal file whose *bytes* are corrupted on disk
//! outside any journal API call — simulating bit rot, a truncated write
//! after a crash mid-`fsync`, or an operator/tooling mistake — and,
//! specifically, what that corruption does to *other, healthy* attempts'
//! recoverability, not just to itself.
