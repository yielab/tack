//! Corrupt-journal adversarial coverage for the local runner journal:
//! tests and the audit report only, no production source touched here.
//!
//! `OwnerOnlyJournal`'s in-module tests already cover a symlinked
//! journal/quarantine directory and a mismatched filename. This file
//! covers what those don't: a journal file corrupted on disk outside any
//! journal API call (bit rot, a truncated write after a crash mid-`fsync`,
//! an operator mistake), and what that does to *other, healthy* attempts'
//! recoverability, not just to itself.

// 2. Finding: one corrupted journal file among several currently blocks
//    the restart recovery scan (`unresolved()`) for *every* attempt, not
//    just the corrupted one — `unresolved()`'s `?` on `load_path` inside
//    its `fs::read_dir` loop propagates the very first `Malformed`/`Io`
//    error it meets, discarding whatever it had already found. This test
//    proves the behavior exists (a safe, documented state — no panic, no
//    blind respawn, no silent data loss) but flags it as an audit finding:
//    a single corrupted attempt's journal can currently deny recovery to
//    every other, healthy, unresolved attempt on the same runner restart.
//    Not fixed here — this file's scope is tests/audit only. The two
//    healthy records stay loadable throughout, proving the *data* survives
//    even though the *scan* currently cannot see past the corrupted entry —
//    a future fix that makes `unresolved()` skip-and-report per file rather
//    than abort-on-first would find this data intact and recoverable.
