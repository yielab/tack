//! Harness process/event infrastructure and the shared adapter-registration
//! seam.
//!
//! [`crate::client::engine::HarnessAdapter`] (re-exported as
//! [`HarnessAdapter`] at this module's root) is the frozen per-attempt
//! lifecycle interface each concrete harness adapter (`codex.rs`,
//! `claude_code.rs`, `opencode.rs`) implements. This module supplies the
//! genuinely separate piece: [`HarnessProbe`], for harness
//! discovery/capability reporting, which has no home in
//! `engine::HarnessAdapter` at all (see "Why `HarnessProbe` is not a sixth
//! `HarnessAdapter` method" below). [`AdapterRegistry`] is the shared
//! registry wiring: a struct that itself implements `engine::HarnessAdapter`
//! by dispatching to whichever concrete adapter matches a claimed attempt's
//! requested harness kind, so `RunnerEngine<P, A, W, C>`'s single `A:
//! HarnessAdapter` can serve all three harnesses through one engine
//! instance. [`process`] and [`event_sink`] are the lower-level primitives
//! the concrete adapters compose inside their own
//! `validate`/`start`/`cancel`/`wait` implementations.
//!
//! ## Why `HarnessProbe` is not a sixth `HarnessAdapter` method
//!
//! `engine::HarnessAdapter`'s five methods all take an `ExecutionSpec` or a
//! `LocalRunHandle` — both of which only exist once a request has been
//! claimed. Capability reporting (`RunnerCapabilities.harnesses`, populated
//! at enrollment/refresh — see `tack_orch::execution::capabilities`) has to
//! run *before* any attempt exists, to tell the scheduler what this runner
//! can even do. There is nowhere on the existing trait to hang that. Rather
//! than forcing capability discovery through a method that would need to
//! fabricate an `ExecutionSpec` to call, [`HarnessProbe`] is a small,
//! separate trait for exactly that: "detect version, report capabilities,
//! independent of any specific attempt."
//!
//! ## Two open interface gaps, proven by three real adapters
//!
//! 1. **`LocalRunHandle` cannot name its own harness kind.** `cancel`/`wait`
//!    take only `&LocalRunHandle { process_id: String }`, with no
//!    harness-kind field, so a dispatching registry has no way to route a
//!    bare handle back to the adapter that produced it. [`AdapterRegistry`]
//!    works around this by encoding the kind into the opaque `process_id`
//!    string it hands back from `start` (see `encode_handle`/`decode_handle`
//!    below) and decoding it again in `cancel`/`wait`/`reconcile`. The
//!    straightforward fix — adding a `harness_kind` field to
//!    `LocalRunHandle` — is still not made: `LocalRunHandle { process_id:
//!    ... }` is constructed by literal in `crates/tack-runner/tests/
//!    crash_matrix.rs:277`, and any new required field breaks that
//!    construction.
//! 2. **Kind-key type duplication, still present.** [`AdapterRegistry`] keys
//!    directly on `tack_orch::execution::HarnessKind` (an opaque string,
//!    matching `ExecutionRequestSnapshot::requested_harness_kind`).
//!    `registry.rs` separately defines its own `HarnessKind` enum
//!    (`Codex`/`ClaudeCode`/`OpenCode`/`Other(String)`). Whether these two
//!    types should be unified, and whether `AdapterRegistry` itself belongs
//!    in `registry.rs` instead of here, remains an open registry-shape
//!    decision.
