//! Bounded, backpressured, redacted harness event streaming.
//!
//! `process.rs` bounds raw stdout/stderr *bytes*; this module bounds the
//! *structured* event stream an adapter derives from a harness's output (one JSON
//! object per line, a parsed tool-call, a progress update — the
//! `docs/contracts/runner-v1/event-batch.request.json` `events[]` shape). Wiring that
//! shape onto the wire is future work (`PullProtocol` has no event-batch method
//! yet); this module is the local, always-available half.
//!
//! Two independent bounds guard against the two ways "memory bounded" can fail:
//! per-payload size ([`EventSinkLimits::max_payload_bytes`], aligned with
//! `limits.json`'s `event_payload_bytes_max`) replaces an oversized payload with an
//! explicit truncation marker rather than silently shortening it
//! ([`EventSinkReport::payloads_truncated`]); backpressure
//! ([`EventSinkLimits::channel_capacity`]) delivers events over a bounded
//! `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel, and [`EventSink::push`] genuinely waits for the
//! consumer once it is full rather than growing an internal buffer.
//!
//! A third bound, [`EventSinkLimits::max_events`], exists because backpressure alone
//! only bounds the *instantaneous* buffer, not the total events a run could ever
//! produce — without it a sink with nobody consuming it would block the producer
//! forever instead of giving a deterministic, testable outcome. Once the lifetime
//! cap is reached, further events are counted in
//! [`EventSinkReport::dropped_after_limit`] and never buffered at all.
