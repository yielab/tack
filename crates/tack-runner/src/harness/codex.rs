//! Codex harness adapter/probe.
//!
//! Implements [`crate::harness::HarnessAdapter`] and
//! [`crate::harness::HarnessProbe`] for
//! `harness_kind = "codex"`, composing the shared process/redaction/artifact
//! infrastructure (`crate::harness::{process, redact, artifact}`).
//!
//! ## Unverified against a real binary
//!
//! Every fake-binary test below drives `crate::harness::fixtures::fake_harness_command`,
//! never a real `codex` process. Three opt-in live tests (bottom of the
//! test module) resolve a real `codex` binary from `PATH` at run time and
//! cleanly skip (print and return, no panic) when it or a further
//! precondition (an opt-in env var, a configured provider secret) is
//! absent; each is additionally `#[ignore]`d so a plain `cargo test` never
//! attempts it. Two of the three (the provider-endpoint tests) have been
//! run against the real binary and their finding is recorded at point (3)
//! below; everything else in this file specific to Codex's real CLI
//! remains a documented **guess**, not a verified fact, called out here and
//! in code comments at its point of use.
//!
//! **Unverified assumptions about Codex's real CLI contract:**
//!
//! 1. The installed binary is literally named `codex` and is found via a
//!    `PATH` search (never a hardcoded path). See [`CodexLocator`].
//! 2. Version detection invokes `codex --version` with exit code 0; the real
//!    CLI (observed: `codex-cli 0.149.1`) prefixes the version with a
//!    program-name token rather than printing it bare, so detection scans
//!    for a strict `X.Y[.Z]` numeric token anywhere in the output rather
//!    than requiring the whole line to be one. See
//!    [`CodexAdapter::detect_version`]/[`find_strict_version_token`].
//! 3. **Measured, not a guess:** non-interactive execution is
//!    `codex exec --json --model <requested model id>` with the agent
//!    profile's instructions piped over **stdin** (never argv, for the same
//!    `ps`/`/proc` exposure reason `process.rs` documents) — confirmed
//!    against the real installed binary (0.149.1), including with a
//!    provider pointed at a different endpoint via per-invocation `-c`
//!    overrides (`model_provider=...`, `model_providers.<key>.*`): the
//!    request genuinely reached that endpoint rather than Codex's built-in
//!    OpenAI provider, and no `~/.codex/config.toml` was written. See
//!    [`CodexAdapter::start`].
//! 4. Because (3) is unverified, **this adapter never attempts to parse
//!    Codex's real stdout/stderr shape.** `terminal_state` is derived solely
//!    from the child's process exit code (`0` → succeeded, nonzero/signalled
//!    → failed, killed-by-timeout → failed). It deliberately does not
//!    special-case the shared fixture's `malformed` mode into a different
//!    outcome — see [`classify_exit`] and the `malformed` test below for why
//!    that would itself be inventing a contract that cannot be verified.
//! 5. Whether/how Codex reports which model it actually used is unverified.
//!    Rather than fabricate an "observed" model, [`ActualExecution`]'s
//!    `model_provider`/`model_id` echo the **requested** selection with
//!    `model_observation_source = "requested_not_confirmed"` — a new value,
//!    not previously present in any frozen fixture (which only exemplifies
//!    `"harness_reported"`).
//! 6. Session resume, a decision/approval protocol, and parseable usage
//!    (token/cost) output are all unverified for Codex. Each is reported
//!    honestly (`unsupported`/`advisory` with a reason) rather than assumed
//!    — see [`CodexAdapter::feature_capabilities`].
//! 7. Codex's real model-discovery mechanism (if any) is unverified, so
//!    [`HarnessCapability::model_combinations`] is always empty — this
//!    adapter never hardcodes a model list: it reports capabilities
//!    without assuming models.
//!
//! ## Why `ActualExecution.model_provider`/`model_id` are non-nullable but
//! this adapter cannot always fill them honestly
//!
//! `ExecutionRequestSnapshot.requested_model_provider`/`requested_model_id`
//! are `Option<...>` — nullable when auto-selection is allowed.
//! `ActualExecution.model_provider`/`model_id` are **not** `Option`. Because
//! this adapter has no verified way to observe which model an auto-selected
//! Codex run actually used, it cannot honestly fill a non-nullable field for
//! that case without fabricating a value, which would be exactly the kind
//! of hidden fake success this codebase forbids. Rather than guess, `validate`
//! rejects a spec with no explicit `requested_model_provider`/`requested_model_id`
//! **pre-spawn** (see [`CodexAdapter::check_selection`]). This is a real,
//! falsifying observation about the frozen contract — non-nullable fields
//! this adapter cannot always honestly fill — not something this adapter
//! resolves unilaterally.
