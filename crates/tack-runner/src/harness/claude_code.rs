//! Claude Code harness adapter.
//!
//! This file implements [`super::HarnessAdapter`] (`engine::HarnessAdapter`,
//! see the module docs on `super` for why it is not redefined here) and
//! [`super::HarnessProbe`] for the `claude` CLI
//! (Anthropic's Claude Code), version `2.1.223` observed installed on the
//! machine this was verified on.
//!
//! ## Observed vs. assumed — read this before trusting a claim below
//!
//! Every behavioral claim in this file was checked by actually invoking the
//! installed `claude` binary from a disposable fixture directory (never this
//! repository). Where a design choice rests on something *not* independently
//! invoked (e.g. the Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry provider families, confirmed
//! only by `strings` against the installed binary, never by an actual
//! provider switch), the comment at that point calls it out explicitly.
//! Nothing here should be read as "this is how Claude Code definitely
//! behaves on every machine" — only "this is what the one installed copy
//! actually did."
//!
//! Concrete findings that shaped this implementation:
//!
//! - `claude --version` prints `"<version> (Claude Code)"` to stdout, exit 0,
//!   empty stderr, and needs neither `HOME` nor `PATH` — a fast, side-effect
//!   free probe (see [`detect_version`]).
//! - `claude -p` reads the prompt from **stdin** when no positional argument
//!   is given. This adapter always uses stdin for the prompt, never argv —
//!   matching [`super::process::ProcessSpec`]'s own documented preference and
//!   keeping the prompt out of `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`.
//! - `--output-format json` (non-streaming) has **no reliable single "model
//!   used" field** — only an aggregate `modelUsage` map that, even for a
//!   single trivial prompt, included a second, unrequested internal model
//!   (`claude-haiku-4-5-...`) alongside the one actually requested. This
//!   adapter uses `--output-format stream-json --verbose` instead, and reads
//!   the authoritative model from the `{"type":"system","subtype":"init"}`
//!   event's `model` field (cross-checked against `assistant` messages).
//! - `is_error` (boolean) is the only reliable success/failure signal.
//!   `subtype` is *not*: an invalid-model 404 was observed with
//!   `"subtype":"success"` alongside `"is_error":true`. This adapter keys
//!   exclusively off `is_error`, never `subtype`.
//! - A persisted per-user settings file (`~/.claude/settings.json`,
//!   `"effortLevel"`) silently changed default behavior in a way that broke
//!   an otherwise-valid invocation (`effort 'xhigh' is not supported when
//!   thinking is disabled`) even with the process environment fully cleared.
//!   This adapter always passes an explicit `--effort high` (verified
//!   compatible across every model exercised) rather than trusting whatever
//!   default a given machine's settings file happens to carry, and passes
//!   `--setting-sources ""` to reduce ambient configuration influence over a
//!   supposedly deterministic run.
//! - Claude Code's own Bash tool runs its command in a **new session**
//!   (distinct `pgid`/`sid` from the top-level `claude` process, confirmed
//!   twice via `ps`), unlike the shared fake harness's `spawn_child` mode
//!   (whose grandchild deliberately stays in-group). A graceful SIGTERM
//!   appeared to let Claude Code clean up that detached session itself, but
//!   a SIGKILL escalation (uncatchable) cannot give it that chance, and
//!   `kill(-pgid, SIGKILL)` does not reach a different session's group. See
//!   `feature_capabilities` below for how this is reflected honestly
//!   (`cancel: Advisory`, not `Supported`) rather than papered over.
//!
//! ## What this adapter does not attempt
//!
//! - Resolving `secret_reference`-only environment entries: no secret-store
//!   client exists in this crate yet. Such entries are skipped with a
//!   `tracing::warn!` (name only) rather than silently dropped or fabricated.
//! - Enumerating installed/available models ahead of a real invocation: the
//!   CLI has no `list-models`-style command, so [`ClaudeCodeAdapter`]'s
//!   [`super::HarnessProbe::probe`] reports zero `model_combinations` rather
//!   than an unverified static alias list ("report capabilities without
//!   assuming models").
//! - Actually exercising the Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry provider paths: doing so
//!   needs real cloud credentials this adapter does not fabricate or request.
