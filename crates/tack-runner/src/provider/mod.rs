//! Runner-side provider endpoints: where a harness sends requests and which
//! credential authenticates them, when that differs from the harness's own
//! ambient login.
//!
//! Every harness this crate drives already has a working, credential-free
//! mode: the harness's own subscription/login (Claude Max, a ChatGPT plan,
//! `codex login`, ...). That mode needs nothing from this module — it is
//! simply the absence of a configured entry for the request's provider, and
//! every function here treats it as `None`/a typed absence, never a second
//! implicit case to branch on.
//!
//! What this module adds is the other mode: `RunnerConfig::providers` names
//! an entry (`[provider.<name>]`), and [`resolve_endpoint`] tells a harness
//! adapter what to inject when a request's provider matches one — a base
//! URL, the name of the environment variable that must carry the
//! credential, and the resolved credential itself. A gateway and a vendor's
//! own direct API are the same shape here — a base URL plus a credential —
//! so a second provider, gateway or direct, is a new [`Provider`]
//! implementation registered in [`registry`], never a new mechanism or a
//! branch inside an adapter, [`resolve_endpoint`] or [`attach_catalog`].
//! Providers do not share a catalog body shape, an auth header placement,
//! or a pricing shape, so each one parses its own catalog into the common
//! [`CatalogEntry`] shape; nothing in this file names a vendor.
//!
//! Two providers exist today: [`vercel_ai_gateway`] and [`anthropic`].
