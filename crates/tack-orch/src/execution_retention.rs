//! Cancellable retention sweep for the execution domain.
//!
//! # Why a sibling module, not `execution::retention`
//!
//! `crate::execution`'s own module doc says it deliberately has no
//! transport, persistence, or vendor adapter dependencies — the pure
//! runner-v1 protocol domain. This module is the opposite: nothing but
//! persistence and a spawned background task, so it sits next to
//! `reconciler.rs` (whose `spawn_retention_sweep`/`RetentionStore` is the
//! closest analog) rather than inside `execution/`.
//!
//! # What's different from orch's own retention sweep
//!
//! `reconciler::spawn_retention_sweep` computes its cutoff from
//! `Utc::now()` directly and has no cancellation signal — dropping its
//! `JoinHandle` is the only way to stop it. This module fixes both:
//! [`RetentionClock`] makes "now" injectable, and
//! [`spawn_execution_retention_sweep`] races a `stop_rx` against its
//! inter-sweep sleep.
//!
//! # No roll-up table for `execution_events` yet
//!
//! Unlike orch (`orch_events` -> `orch_events_daily`), there is no
//! daily-aggregate table here — this purges terminal-attempt event rows
//! outright rather than aggregating them first.
