//! `tack-orch` — the control-plane orchestration client for Tack.
//!
//! Defines [`ControlPlane`], the trait every agent-fleet backend (docket today,
//! something else tomorrow) implements, plus the DTOs that cross the
//! Tack ⇄ control-plane boundary. Concrete adapters (`adapters::docket`, Wave 1)
//! and the reconciler poll loop (`reconciler`, Wave 1) build on top of this.
//!
//! # Dependency direction
//!
//! This crate depends inward on `tack-core` and `tack-db` only. **It must never
//! depend on `tack-api`.** `tack-api` depends on `tack-orch` — to spawn the
//! reconciler and to expose the `/api/control-planes`, `/api/fleet`, and
//! dispatch routes — not the other way around. If you're an agent reaching for
//! `tack-api` types from in here (e.g. to reuse a handler DTO), stop: define the
//! type here instead and let `tack-api` depend on it, or duplicate the small
//! shape rather than inverting the graph. See `TODO.md` §1.1 and
//! `docs/book/src/developer/orchestration.md`.
//!
//! # Money is always an estimate
//!
//! Every dollar-valued field in this crate is named `*_usd_estimated` (never
//! `*_usd` alone) — token counts are the primary, trustworthy measure; docket's
//! own driver does not report real spend (see `docket/core/dispatch.py`'s
//! `pod_gating_cost`), so any dollar figure downstream of it is derived, not
//! recorded. See `TODO.md` §0 rule 6.
//!
//! # Unknown enum values never fail a poll
//!
//! [`RunState`], [`RunSource`], [`TaskStatus`], and [`ApprovalState`] each carry
//! an `Unknown(String)` fallback variant with a hand-written `Deserialize` (a
//! plain `#[serde(other)]` only works on unit variants, and we need the
//! original string preserved so it can round-trip back out). A docket upgrade
//! that adds a new state must degrade to "shown as-is", never to a
//! deserialization error that kills the reconciler's poll loop.

// "docket can do this" (or hard-code the one case it can't, e.g. the budget-
// pause note `frontend/src/features/settings/orchestration/format.ts` used
// to carry as a prose string). A second adapter with a genuinely different
// shape (no pods, no roles, no approval store) breaks that assumption
// silently unless "what can this plane do" becomes a value the caller reads,
// not a fact baked into a component. TODO.md §II.0 rule 6: "a capability is
// a value, never a provider check" — `rg -n "kind === 'docket'"` in
// `frontend/src` must stay empty.
