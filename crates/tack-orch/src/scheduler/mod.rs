//! The deterministic fleet scheduler.
//!
//! This module is a pure decision library: given a candidate set of runners
//! (their current health/capacity/labels/declared harness and model
//! support) and a request (exact runner or fleet selector, required
//! harness, optional provider/model, priority), it returns either a
//! selected runner or a typed reason none qualify. It performs **no I/O**
//! — no database, no reconciler, no network client — and it **never grants
//! the authoritative lease**; only the repository's fenced claim
//! (`docs/contracts/runner-v1/`) can do that.
//! [`wiring::choose_request_for_runner`] wires this module's inputs to the
//! real `agent_runners` / `agent_fleet_members` / `execution_requests`
//! tables (`crates/tack-db/src/migrations.rs`, migrations 039–044) and is
//! called ahead of, or as a replacement for, the naive `ORDER BY created_at
//! LIMIT 1` match in `crates/tack-db/src/repo/execution.rs`'s claim query.
//!
//! # Two entry points
//!
//! - [`select::select_runner`] — one request against a candidate pool.
//!   Pure, synchronous, deterministic.
//! - [`batch::schedule`] — several requests sharing one candidate pool,
//!   ordered by priority then FIFO fairness, with capacity consumed across
//!   the pass. Built on top of [`select::select_runner`], not a separate
//!   algorithm.
//!
//! # Why this crate, not `tack-db` or `tack-api`
//!
//! `tack-orch` already depends inward on `tack-core` and `tack-db` only
//! (see this crate's top-level doc comment) and must never depend on
//! `tack-api` — exactly the shape a pure selection library needs: it can
//! reuse `execution::` domain types (`HarnessKind`, `RunnerId`,
//! `RunnerSelector`, `HarnessCapability`, …) without pulling in HTTP,
//! `sqlx`, or any transport concern.
//!
//! # Live wiring
//!
//! [`wiring::choose_request_for_runner`] fetches real
//! `agent_runners`/`agent_fleet_members`/`execution_requests` rows via a
//! live `tack_db::Repository`, builds the [`RunnerCandidate`]/
//! [`SchedulingRequest`] values above from them, and calls
//! [`select::select_runner`]/[`batch::schedule`] — still performing no
//! write of its own. `crates/tack-api/src/handlers/runner_protocol.rs`'s
//! `claim` handler is the only caller in production.
