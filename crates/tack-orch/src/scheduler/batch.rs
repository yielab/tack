//! Priority/fairness scheduling across several requests sharing one
//! candidate pool.
//!
//! [`select_runner`](super::select::select_runner) answers "which runner for
//! *this* request" in isolation. [`schedule`] answers the question a real
//! dispatch pass actually has: several queued requests, a shared, finite
//! pool of runners, deciding who goes first. It is still pure — no I/O, no
//! lease granted, `now` supplied by the caller — and still deterministic:
//! ordering never depends on the input slices' arrival order, only their
//! content.

/// Schedules every request in `requests` against the shared `candidates`
/// pool, honoring [`super::types::Priority`] and FIFO fairness within a
/// priority tier. Requests are processed highest priority first; within a
/// priority, oldest `created_at` first; any remaining tie is broken by
/// `request_id`, so processing order never depends on `requests`' input
/// slice order.
///
/// **Capacity is consumed within the batch, but only here.** A runner
/// [`select_runner`] selects for an earlier request has its
/// `available_capacity` reduced by one for every later request in the same
/// call, so two same-priority requests never both get told "yes" for a
/// single-slot runner. This bookkeeping is local to one `schedule` call —
/// the authoritative ledger is `agent_runners.available_capacity`,
/// decremented only by the repository's fenced claim; re-derive
/// `candidates` from fresh state before the next call.
