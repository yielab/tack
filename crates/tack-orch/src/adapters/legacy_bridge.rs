//! The Docket compatibility decision and its explicit
//! label/policy, plus the pure, DB-free pieces of "one scheduling owner."
//!
//! # Decision: maintain
//!
//! Three options exist for the legacy Docket bridge: maintain, export, or
//! deprecate it. This module maintains it, on this evidence, gathered by
//! reading the code rather than assuming:
//!
//! - The legacy Docket bridge (`adapters::docket`, `reconciler.rs`, `tack-api::
//!   dispatcher`, `tack-api::sprint_dispatch`, `tack-api::handlers::orch`, the
//!   `orch_*` tables) is not a stub or a dead prototype. It is live-verified against
//!   a real `docket serve` instance (see `adapters::docket`'s module doc,
//!   "Verified live against a real docket server"), wired into auto-dispatch, sprint
//!   DAG-ordered dispatch, an approvals inbox, agent-fleet status, and economics —
//!   none of which the runner-v1 domain replaces today. `runner-v1` has no
//!   DAG-ordered sprint dispatch and no `pre_input` guardrail-policy engine;
//!   deprecating the bridge would delete working capability with no replacement,
//!   not retire dead code.
//! - It carries real regression coverage that would need to be reproduced from
//!   scratch under "deprecate": `docket_adapter_test.rs`, `docket_wire_contract_test.
//!   rs` (per-method wire oracle), `docket_tick_contract_test.rs` (tick-level
//!   request-sequence oracle), plus `orch_dispatch_test.rs`, `orch_reconciler_wiring_
//!   test.rs`, `auto_dispatch_test.rs`, `sprint_dispatch_test.rs`,
//!   `orch_approvals_test.rs`, and more in `tack-api`/`tack-db`.
//! - "Export" (migrate `orch_*` data into the neutral `execution_requests`/
//!   `execution_attempts` shape and drop the bridge) was considered and rejected:
//!   docket's own capability snapshot (`DocketAdapter::capabilities`) reports
//!   `cancel: false`, `artifacts: false`, `model_selection: Unsupported` — an
//!   `execution_attempts` row asserts fields (fencing token, isolated workspace
//!   identity, capability snapshot used for validation) docket's wire protocol has
//!   no source data for. Forcing a Docket-origin task into that shape would mean
//!   inventing values for fields the runner-v1 contract requires to be either
//!   measured or explicitly `not_measured`/typed-absent — the kind of structural
//!   zero this codebase's rules forbid. A real export needs its own migration and
//!   design.
//! - `TACK_ORCH_ENABLE` already makes Docket **optional** at the infrastructure
//!   level — unset, the reconciler never spawns and every `orch_*` route returns
//! `409 orchestration_disabled`. "Maintain" does not mean "mandatory";
//!   it means "keep working, keep tested, keep optional."
//!
//! # The compatibility label
//!
//! [`LEGACY_DOCKET_COMPATIBILITY_LABEL`] is the one explicit, stable string
//! naming this decision. It is not wired into any API response — no route
//! in `tack-api::handlers::orch` currently surfaces a compatibility label
//! field, and adding one would be a `handlers/orch.rs` response-shape
//! change. It exists today as the one place this decision's name and
//! meaning are written down for code to reference, and for
//! `docs/GITHUB-SYNC.md`/`docs/MCP.md`-style operator docs to quote
//! verbatim rather than paraphrase.
//!
//! # One scheduling owner
//!
//! [`SchedulingOwner`] names the two planes that can claim a Tack item's execution.
//! The invariant — Docket is optional and has one documented compatibility state,
//! and runner-v1 and Docket must never dual-dispatch the same item — reduces to
//! one rule: **runner-v1 always outranks legacy Docket.** If an item has an active
//! `execution_requests` row, legacy dispatch must defer; the reverse is not
//! enforced (see below) but is asymmetric by design, not by oversight — runner-v1
//! is the plan-of-record scheduler, and Docket is explicitly optional and never
//! the owner of a new runner request.
//!
//! [`decide_scheduling_owner`] is the pure decision function — no I/O, fully unit
//! tested here. The actual enforcement (reading `execution_requests`, refusing to
//! call docket) lives in `tack_api::dispatcher::dispatch_item`:
//! `tack_db::repo::orch::Repository::has_active_execution_request_for_item` is a
//! read-only query in `repo/orch.rs`, and `dispatcher.rs`'s call site is
//! documented there. **The mirror guard is not implemented** —
//! `tack-api::handlers::executions` (`POST /api/executions`) does not check
//! `orch_tasks` before creating a new request, so a caller can still create a
//! runner-v1 request that collides with an item Docket already owns. A collision
//! test (`crates/tack-api/tests/g1_dual_dispatch_test.rs`) documents — rather than
//! hides — this open asymmetry.
//!
//! # Provider-scoped ids and the normalized-attempt projection
//!
//! An `orch_tasks` row's `remote_task_id` is a bare string minted by docket, with no
//! namespace of its own — nothing stops it from colliding, in principle, with an
//! opaque model id or a runner-v1 attempt id if either were ever displayed
//! side-by-side. [`provider_scoped_task_id`] prefixes it with the fixed provider tag
//! `"docket"` (`docket:<remote_task_id>`), mirroring the shape a genuine runner-v1
//! request snapshot uses for its requested model-provider and opaque model id
//! (each independently nullable) without claiming to *be* one.
//! [`LegacyAttemptProjection`] is a read-only, in-memory view that maps an
//! `OrchTask` (the existing `tack_db::repo::orch::OrchTask` read-side struct) into
//! that provider-scoped shape for display — it does not write into
//! `execution_attempts`, does not claim runner-v1 provenance, and is not consulted
//! by the scheduler. It exists so a future operator surface has one normalized
//! place to render "what is this legacy row, using which provider-scoped id, under
//! which scheduling owner" without re-deriving the mapping.
