//! `DocketAdapter` — the [`ControlPlane`] implementation for docket.
//!
//! # Constructor
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let adapter = DocketAdapter::new("http://127.0.0.1:7331", Some(token))?;
//! let plane: std::sync::Arc<dyn tack_orch::ControlPlane> = std::sync::Arc::new(adapter);
//! ```
//!
//! `new` takes the docket base URL (any trailing slash is normalized away)
//! and an optional Bearer token. A `None` token is a legitimate
//! configuration — every unauthenticated route (`/health`, `/status.json`,
//! `/metrics`) still works, and calling an authenticated route without one
//! degrades to whatever docket itself returns for a missing
//! `Authorization` header (a real 401, mapped to [`OrchError::Auth`]) rather
//! than being special-cased client-side, since that is both simpler and
//! exactly what a caller would observe by hand.
//!
//! # Auth split
//!
//! `/status.json`, `/metrics`, and `/health` never carry
//! a Bearer token, even if one is configured — every other route
//! (`/runs`, `/runs/{id}`, `/approvals`, `/tasks/{project}`,
//! `/traces/{project}`, plus the write routes) does. This is
//! enforced structurally by [`DocketAdapter::get_unauthed`] vs.
//! [`DocketAdapter::get_authed`] never sharing a code path that attaches
//! the header — a future edit can't accidentally leak the token onto an
//! unauthenticated request by adding one branch to a shared function.
//!
//! # Write methods
//!
//! **`enqueue_task`, `decide_approval`, and `provision_pod` are all
//! implemented** — see below. [`ControlPlane::dispatch`]
//! still returns [`OrchError::Disabled`] unconditionally — not because
//! docket lacks the route (`POST /dispatch/{project}` is a real,
//! live-verified endpoint too) but because it's a distinct
//! pipeline-run trigger (body = arbitrary `variables`) with no consumer in
//! Tack yet. Wiring it now, with no caller and no design for the
//! surrounding safety properties, would just be dead code.
//!
//! `decide_approval`'s implementation sends a fixed `channel: "tack"` on
//! every decision (verified against `approval.APPROVAL_CHANNELS` in
//! docket's `core/approval.py`, which already lists
//! `"tack"` alongside `cli`/`http`/`mcp`/`telegram`/`timeout`) — see the
//! trait doc for why this isn't a parameter. The **separate**
//! `TACK_ORCH_APPROVAL_TOKEN` gate sits one layer up, in
//! `tack-api`'s HTTP handler — this adapter has no concept of it, the same
//! way it has no concept of Tack's ordinary `TACK_API_TOKEN`.
//!
//! `enqueue_task`'s implementation deliberately does **not** parse
//! `status`/`approvalToken` off `POST /tasks/{project}`'s response body,
//! even though both are present on the wire (see "Verified live" below) —
//! [`ControlPlane::enqueue_task`]'s signature (`Result<String, OrchError>`)
//! has nowhere to carry them out, and widening it is a separate, larger
//! change than this method needs (see the trait doc's own note on this).
//! `tack-api`'s `dispatcher` module recovers that
//! information with one follow-up call to the already-fully-implemented
//! [`ControlPlane::list_tasks`], matching the just-created task by the id
//! this method returns. See that module's doc comment for the full
//! reasoning; this adapter only needs to get the id right.
//!
//! A `pre_input` policy **block** (HTTP 400) is mapped to
//! [`OrchError::PolicyBlocked`] — the policy id is
//! parsed out of docket's own error text
//! (`"task rejected by guardrail policy '<id>' at enqueue: <message>"`) by
//! [`parse_policy_block`].
//!
//! # Verified live against a real docket server
//!
//! Every route this adapter uses was
//! exercised against a real, isolated `docket serve` instance — not just
//! read from `serve.py`/`core/dispatch.py` source. The facts below are
//! recorded because some directly contradict what docket's own docs say:
//!
//! - **`POST /tasks/{project}`'s success response is `{"ok": true, "task":
//!   "<id>", "project": "...", "status": "pending"|"waiting_approval",
//!   "approvalToken"?: "..."}`, not `{"taskId": "..."}`.** The task id is
//!   under the key `"task"`, and a `require_approval`
//!   verdict adds `"approvalToken"` alongside `"status": "waiting_approval"`
//!   rather than a separate response shape. [`NewRemoteTask`] (the request
//!   body this adapter would send) is unaffected — only the response this
//!   adapter doesn't parse yet (because [`ControlPlane::enqueue_task`] is
//!   disabled) differs from docket's own docs. Whoever wires this up must
//!   not deserialize a `taskId` field — it doesn't exist on the wire.
//! - **The `pre_input` gate's three outcomes, and the `trusted` boundary,**
//!   confirmed against a real server: a `block` verdict returns HTTP 400 with
//!   `{"ok": false, "error": "task rejected by guardrail policy '<id>' at
//!   enqueue: <message>"}`; a `require_approval` verdict returns HTTP 200
//!   with the task's real `status` (`"waiting_approval"`, never
//!   `"pending"`) and its `approvalToken`; and passing `trusted: false`
//!   explicitly in the request body genuinely flips a `prompt-injection`-id
//!   policy from silently skipped to evaluated — while omitting `trusted`
//!   entirely reproduces every existing caller's behavior (operator trust,
//!   the policy skipped) exactly as `core/dispatch.py::enqueue_task`'s
//!   docstring says. This is a prompt-injection boundary; it is confirmed
//!   real, not just read from source.
//! - **`POST /approvals/{token}` grant genuinely resumes a gated task**
//!   (`waiting_approval` → `pending`, confirmed via a follow-up `GET
//!   /tasks/{project}`) and returns `{"ok": true, "token": "...", "state":
//!   "granted"}`; an unknown token 404s with `{"ok": false, "error":
//!   "Approval not found: <token>"}`. `deny` and the
//!   409/`ApprovalNoop` (already-decided) path were not verified live — read
//!   directly from `core/approval.py`'s source instead (`approval_grant`/
//!   `approval_deny` raise `ApprovalNoop` only for "already granted"/
//!   "already denied or expired" respectively; any other non-`pending` state
//!   raises the plain `ApprovalError` that `serve.py` maps to 404 alongside
//!   a genuinely unknown token) — `decide_approval`'s classification below
//!   follows that reading, not a live capture, for the 409/404 split.
//! - **`POST /pods`**, against an isolated `docket serve`
//!   (`DOCKET_HOME` pointed at a scratch dir, `~/.docket`'s mtime confirmed
//!   unchanged before and after): a fresh `POST /pods` returns `201
//!   {"ok": true, "project", "blueprint", "members": [{"id", "role",
//!   "model"}]}` exactly as [`ProvisionedPod`]/[`ProvisionedPodMember`]
//!   model it; a second call for the same `project` returns `409
//!   {"ok": false, "error": "'<project>' already exists"}`; an unknown
//!   blueprint, a missing `project`, and a `pod` value other than `"full"`
//!   each return `400` with a plain `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` body
//!   (same shape [`ErrorBody`] already extracts for `enqueue_task`/
//!   `decide_approval`); a request with no `Authorization` header returns
//!   `401`. Ran this crate's own compiled [`DocketAdapter::provision_pod`]
//!   against the live server (not just a hand-built `curl`), confirming the
//!   happy path and the 409 both decode correctly end to end.
//!
//! # `list_tasks` / `traces`
//!
//! Both routes exist in docket, shipped in its own Phase 22
//! (`GET /tasks/{project}`, `GET /traces/{project}?since=`),
//! verified directly against `serve.py`'s `do_GET`, not against
//! docket's own `ROADMAP.md` (which still lists them `TODO` — a real
//! staleness bug in that project's own docs). If either
//! route 404s against a real docket instance today, that means the plane is
//! running an older docket build, not that the endpoint is hypothetical —
//! [`OrchError::NotFound`] still surfaces exactly as before so callers
//! (`reconciler::poll_traces`) can tell "this plane doesn't have the
//! capability yet" apart from a real outage ([`OrchError::Auth`]/
//! [`OrchError::Http`] are unaffected by any of this).
//!
//! **`traces`'s wire-format trap, verified against `serve.py`'s
//! `_traces_page`/`do_GET` directly:** the real
//! response is `{"events": [...], "next": "<cursor>"}`, but `events` is an
//! array of **raw JSON strings**, not parsed objects — `_traces_page`
//! returns the verbatim JSONL lines `core.trace.export_lines` read off
//! disk, and `do_GET` calls `json.dumps` on that list of strings without
//! ever parsing them back into objects first. So every element of `events`
//! must be JSON-decoded a *second* time to reach the real event record
//! ([`TracesResponse`] below reflects this: `events: Vec<String>`, not
//! `Vec<RemoteEvent>`). `next` is docket's own minted resume cursor
//! (`serve.py`'s module comment above `_traces_page` documents the
//! compound `"<ts>Z:<n>"` format and why a bare last-seen timestamp isn't
//! enough) — this adapter reads `next` and
//! returns it verbatim as [`TracesPage::next`], opaque to this crate. Do not
//! reintroduce a client-side reconstruction of docket's cursor algorithm —
//! see `reconciler.rs`'s module doc for why one was tried and removed.
