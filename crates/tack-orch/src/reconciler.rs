//! The orchestration reconciler: one background `tokio` task per registered
//! control plane, polling it on an interval and driving the
//! `healthy` → `degraded` → `unreachable` state machine.
//!
//! # Fetch, decide, persist — never a write held across an HTTP call
//!
//! Each poll tick runs in three phases that cannot interleave, by
//! construction: **fetch** ([`reconcile_once`]) makes every HTTP call the
//! tick needs and touches no database handle; **decide**
//! ([`HealthTracker::observe`]) is a pure, synchronous transition over the
//! fetch result; **persist** ([`spawn_one`]'s `store.record_health(...)`
//! call) is one short write, strictly after phase 1 has resolved. Adding a
//! new `poll_*` step means one field on [`FetchOutcome`], one `poll_*`
//! function, and one line in [`reconcile_once`]; a data-ingestion failure
//! (runs/approvals/traces/metrics) must never affect the health verdict —
//! only `/health` and `/status.json` do.
//!
//! # Trace cursor and event id
//!
//! [`crate::TracesPage::next`] is opaque and forwarded verbatim — never
//! reconstructed client-side. `orch_events.id` has no natural key, so
//! [`derive_event_id`] hashes the event's content instead — see that
//! function's own doc for the collision caveat and the retention interplay.
//!
//! # Not wired at boot
//!
//! [`spawn_retention_sweep`] is built and tested but has no caller in
//! `tack-api::server` — fleet-wide orch event/metric retention does not
//! actually run until something spawns it.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Supervisor — keeps the running set of per-plane

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **The bug this replaces.** `spawn_reconcilers`/the old
// `spawn_reconcilers_cancellable` each called `store.list_registered()`
// exactly once and spawned one `spawn_one` task per plane found at that
// instant — the list was never re-read. A control plane registered *after*
// the reconciler started was therefore never polled: no task, no health
// updates, no run/approval/trace/metric mirroring, and no error anywhere,
// because nothing failed — the snapshot was simply stale forever. This
// mattered in practice because "enable orchestration -> register a control
// plane -> link a project" is the natural setup order (and exactly what the
// guided setup wizard walks a user through), so the bug landed squarely in
// the first-run path.
//
// **Why a supervisor loop, not an event from the create/delete handlers.**
// Two shapes were on the table: (a) a background loop that periodically
// re-reads `list_registered()` and diffs it against the currently-running
// task set, or (b) the control-plane create/delete handlers notifying the
// runtime directly. (b) is lower-latency in the common case, but every
// future write path that can change `control_planes` (a bulk import, a
// direct DB edit, a restore from backup) has to remember to signal it, and
// any path that doesn't is a silent repeat of this exact bug. (a)
// self-heals regardless of *how* the table changed — including a row
// deleted directly in the database, which no handler-notification scheme
// can observe by construction — at the cost of a bounded polling delay
// ([`DEFAULT_SUPERVISOR_SCAN_SECS`], deliberately small: a few seconds, not
// the per-plane `poll_secs`). The goal is self-healing regardless of how the
// table changed, and the delay is small enough not to hurt the wizard's
// "register -> see it come alive" moment, so (a) is what's implemented.
// Nothing here rules out adding an event-driven nudge later
// (e.g. the create-control-plane handler could shrink the *next* scan's
// wait by writing to a `Notify`) if the scan interval ever needs to be
// larger than a few seconds; it isn't needed today and would be a second
// cancellation-adjacent mechanism for no observable benefit yet.
//
// **What's reused, what's new.** Every per-plane poller is still exactly
// [`spawn_one`], with exactly the same fetch -> decide -> persist -> sleep
// shape and the same `watch`-channel stop signal each poller already uses —
// the supervisor just gives each plane its *own* channel and sender instead
// of one shared broadcast for the whole fleet, so it can stop a single
// plane's poller (deleted) without touching the others. This is the same
// primitive multiplied per-plane, not a second cancellation mechanism.
