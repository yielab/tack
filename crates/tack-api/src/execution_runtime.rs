//! Runtime start/stop control for the execution-domain retention sweep and
//! health watch (card III-F5, Wave 5).
//!
//! Mirrors `orch_runtime.rs`'s own start/stop shape (a `tokio::sync::watch`
//! stop signal, one "generation" tracked at a time) with one deliberate
//! difference: [`ExecutionRuntime::stop`] *joins* both background tasks
//! before returning, where `OrchRuntime::stop` explicitly does not (its own
//! doc comment: "does not block waiting for the tasks to actually exit").
//! This card's acceptance bar is "shutdown joins task" — a real `.await` on
//! the `JoinHandle`, not merely a signal-and-return — so this type cannot
//! reuse that precedent's semantics even though the surrounding shape is
//! the same. `server.rs` calls this once, after `axum::serve(...)` returns
//! from graceful shutdown, so a slightly-blocking join here costs nothing:
//! by that point every HTTP request has already stopped.
//!
//! # Why this file is thin
//!
//! All retention/observability *logic* — the cancellable spawn loops, the
//! `ExecutionRetentionStore`/`ExecutionObservabilityStore` traits, and their
//! real `tack_db::Repository`-backed implementations — lives in
//! `tack_orch::execution_retention`/`execution_observability` (that crate
//! already depends on `tack-db` directly; see those modules' own doc
//! comments for why the concrete adapters live there rather than being
//! re-implemented in this crate). This module only wires configuration +
//! the repository into those spawn functions and gives `server.rs` one
//! `start()`/`stop()` pair to call.
//!
//! # III-F6d amendment: a third, `tack-api`-local sweep
//!
//! `sweep_artifacts`/`sweep_events` (`handlers/runner_protocol/retention.rs`,
//! card III-F2) and `expire_overdue_decisions` (`handlers/decisions.rs`, card
//! III-F1) were both built and tested in isolation, then correctly deferred
//! their own recurring-task wiring to "whatever interval/task shape" this
//! card built — and nothing ever did. They cannot be added to
//! `tack_orch::execution_retention::spawn_execution_retention_sweep` the way
//! the "why this file is thin" section above describes, because both live in
//! `tack-api`, and `tack-orch` must never depend on `tack-api` (CLAUDE.md:
//! "the dependency points inward, `tack-api` depends on this crate"). So
//! `spawn_artifact_and_decision_sweep` below is a second, `tack-api`-local
//! spawn loop, structurally mirroring `execution_retention`'s own (same
//! `watch`-based stop signal, same immediate-first-tick-then-interval
//! shape, same "log and retry next cycle" error handling) but calling
//! `tack-api`'s own functions directly instead of going through a
//! cross-crate trait. It rides the exact same `TACK_EXECUTION_RETENTION_*`
//! config (`enable`/`days`/`interval_secs`) as the sweep above — one
//! schedule, one gate, for every deletion this domain performs. This file
//! is therefore no longer *only* wiring in the narrowest sense (it now owns
//! one real loop's control flow), but the loop's body is still nothing but
//! calls into other modules' already-tested functions — no new retention
//! *policy* is decided here.
