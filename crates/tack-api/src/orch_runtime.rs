//! Runtime start/stop control for the orchestration reconciler: makes the enable flag
//! a runtime setting (`PUT /api/settings/orchestration`) instead of boot-time-only.
//!
//! [`OrchRuntime::stop`] signals every task via a `tokio::sync::watch`; a task
//! mid-fetch finishes that tick and exits at its next safe point, never mid-HTTP-call
//! or mid-transaction. It holds at most one running generation, so a `start()` racing
//! a `stop()` can never observe "half stopped" state — see `tack_orch::reconciler`
//! for the per-plane lifecycle, which this module no longer owns.
