//! Unit economics (Phase 38 / card D5, tasks 38.1-38.4): tokens, estimated cost,
//! agent-vs-human lead time, and rework rate, sliced by `project_type` and
//! `item_type`. Read-only aggregate endpoints over `Repository::
//! list_completed_item_economics`/`list_item_ids_with_rework_signal`
//! (`tack_db::repo::economics`) — no live docket call, so a plane outage can never
//! turn into a 500 here, the same discipline `handlers::orch`'s module doc names for
//! `GET /api/fleet`.
//!
//! **Gated behind `TACK_ORCH_ENABLE`.** [`economics_routes`] is merged into
//! `router.rs`'s `orch_routes()`, which applies `orch::require_orch_enabled` once as a
//! layer over the whole sub-router — every route below inherits it without a
//! per-handler check, and 404s (not 200-with-empty-data) when the flag is unset,
//! matching TODO.md §0 rule 8.
//!
//! **Rule 6, applied on every response this module returns.** Token counts
//! (`tokens_in`/`tokens_out`) are always present and rendered first; every dollar
//! figure is named `cost_usd_estimated` (never "cost" or "spend") and travels with a
//! `pricing_snapshot_at` that is honestly `None` today (no pricing-snapshot mechanism
//! exists anywhere in this codebase yet — confirmed against A4's and D2's own
//! handoffs, which found the identical gap). The frontend must render it through
//! `shared/agentActivity/format.ts#formatEstimatedCost` — reused verbatim, not
//! reimplemented, per this card's explicit instruction.
//!
//! **Three honesty decisions this module makes, spelled out because the card asked
//! for them to be stated, not just implemented (TODO.md, card D5):**
//!
//! 1. **Minimum sample size — [`MIN_SAMPLE_SIZE`].** Below it, [`LeadTimeStat`] and
//!    [`ReworkStat`] report `below_min_sample: true` and raw counts/durations, never
//!    a derived average or rate a reader could mistake for a stable signal.
//! 2. **Selection bias — [`LEAD_TIME_SELECTION_BIAS_NOTE`].** Carried on every
//!    [`EconomicsSlice`] that has a lead-time comparison, not linked from a doc.
//!    Items reach an agent via auto-dispatch (which only fires on specific statuses)
//!    or because a person chose to hand them off — neither is a random sample of all
//!    work, so a shorter average agent lead time is at least as consistent with
//!    "people dispatch the easy stuff" as with "agents are faster." This module
//!    deliberately never computes a single "agents are Nx faster" ratio: both
//!    populations' stats are reported side by side and left for the reader to
//!    compare, exactly the discipline card D2's handoff set for cost ratios ("never
//!    shows a bare percentage / ratio without the caveat attached").
//! 3. **Retention truncation — [`REWORK_RATE_DEFINITION`] / [`REWORK_TRUNCATION_NOTE`].**
//!    `orch_tasks` (tokens, cost, dispatch timestamps) is never purged — only
//!    `orch_events`/`orch_metrics` are, by the Phase 34.6 retention sweep. So token,
//!    cost, and lead-time figures below are NOT subject to truncation, and this
//!    module says so rather than blanket-hedging every number on the page. Only the
//!    rework signal (which lives in `orch_events`) can go stale: an item whose only
//!    dispatch attempt predates `TACK_ORCH_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` is excluded from the
//!    rework-rate denominator entirely (`ReworkStat::attempts_excluded_stale`), never
//!    counted as "no rework happened" — see `tack_db::repo::economics`'s module doc
//!    for the underlying schema gap (`orch_events.run_id` is always `NULL` today, so
//!    correlation is item-level, not attempt-level).
