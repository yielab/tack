//! Operator decision-resolution repository/service/handler
//! module. Registered in `handlers.rs` and merged into the operator router
//! in `router.rs`'s `operator_execution_routes` — **before** the
//! `require_token` layer is applied and **with** `inject_operator_principal`
//! layered directly on top, exactly like every other route that function
//! merges.
//!
//! # `TACK_EXECUTION_DECISION_TOKEN`
//!
//! [`require_decision_token`] mirrors
//! `handlers::orch::require_approval_token` exactly, closing a real
//! contract-vs-implementation gap:
//! `docs/contracts/runner-v1/protocol.json` names decision
//! resolution a `"separately_scoped_operator_credential"` (distinct from the
//! plain `operator_session_or_api_token` every other operator route uses),
//! and `errors/forbidden.json`'s frozen example carries
//! `"required_scope":"operator:decisions"`. `TACK_EXECUTION_DECISION_TOKEN`
//! is that second, independent credential — checked here, on top of (not
//! instead of) the `x-tack-principal` check below, fail-closed when unset
//! exactly like `TACK_ORCH_APPROVAL_TOKEN`. See `require_decision_token`'s
//! own doc comment for the full rationale and `CLAUDE.md`'s config table for
//! the environment variable.
//!
//! # Security boundary: runner may raise/read, never resolve
//!
//! This module reads exactly one identity signal: the `x-tack-principal`
//! header (see [`principal`]). It never reads `Authorization` at all — no
//! code path here can authenticate, or even inspect, a runner bearer
//! credential. That is the entire enforcement mechanism for "a runner may
//! raise and read its own attempt's decision (`POST .../decisions`, `POST
//! .../decisions/poll`, both in `handlers/runner_protocol.rs`) but
//! never resolve it": resolution lives on a structurally separate route
//! family (mounted on `/api` behind `require_token`, a sibling of
//! `/api/runner/v1` exactly as `CLAUDE.md`'s "Two authentication surfaces,
//! separated structurally" describes for every other operator/runner pair),
//! not an exemption entry on the runner surface, and the runner credential
//! carries zero privilege here even if presented — proven in
//! `f1_decisions_test.rs`'s `self_resolution_is_denied_*` tests.
//!
//! `docs/contracts/runner-v1/protocol.json`'s `authentication` block names
//! `decision_resolution` a "separately_scoped_operator_credential" — distinct
//! wording from the plain `operator_session_or_api_token` every other
//! operator route uses, and `errors/forbidden.json`'s example carries
//! `"required_scope":"operator:decisions"`. Tack's actual operator-auth model
//! (`middleware::require_token`) is a single shared bearer token with no
//! scope/claim system at all (see `middleware.rs`'s own
//! `operator_principal_value` doc comment: "a single shared bearer token, not
//! per-user sessions"). This route is mounted behind the same `require_token`
//! gate every other operator route uses — the stricter scoped-credential
//! reading the contract describes remains an open contract-vs-implementation
//! gap, not silently resolved.
//!
//! # No item-status mapping
//!
//! `execution_requests.status_map_policy_id` (migration 044) is a bare
//! nullable `TEXT` column with **zero interpreter anywhere in this
//! codebase** — grep confirms it is threaded verbatim through every layer
//! (CLI args, request snapshot, DB column) and never once read back to
//! decide anything. Nothing defines what a policy id resolves to: which
//! decision kinds/answers map to which item statuses, or even what shape a
//! "policy" is. Inventing that mapping now would mean fabricating an
//! unrequested, uncontracted format.
//! This module therefore treats "status mapping only
//! after commit through the workflow engine" as a **structural
//! guarantee with nothing to hang a policy off of yet**: no function in this
//! file ever writes `items.status`, directly or indirectly, full stop —
//! proven by `expiry_never_touches_item_status` and
//! `resolve_never_touches_item_status` in `f1_decisions_test.rs`. Wiring a
//! real mapping is future work that first needs a policy schema/format
//! decision from whoever owns `status_map_policy_id`'s contract.
