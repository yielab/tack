//! HTTP-handler integration tests for `tack-api`: CRUD across every
//! operator-facing resource, the executions/runner-admin handlers exercised
//! directly against their own routes, the same lifecycle proven again
//! through the real production router, the two focused read-only
//! runner/attempt routes, economics reporting, optimistic item-version
//! concurrency, and template provisioning's rollback behavior.
