//! runner are the same person on the same machine (see
//! `docs/adr/0058-standalone-single-binary-runner.md`).
//!
//! This module only ever creates the *pending* runner and mints its
//! one-time token — the administrative half of enrollment, the same
//! operation a human triggers by hand via `POST /api/runners/enrollment`.
//! Redeeming that token for a durable credential is unchanged: it still
//! happens over real runner-v1 HTTP inside `tack_runner::bootstrap::run`,
//! exactly like any remote runner. Nothing here calls a runner-protocol
//! route or reaches into `crates/tack-runner/src/transport.rs`.

/// `refresh` first and only reads `enrollment_credential` if that refresh is
/// rejected, at which point failing loudly — the session was invalid and no
