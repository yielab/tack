//! it as the whole process, `tack serve` (with or without `--with-runner`)
//! runs it as a controllable task alongside the server in the same
//! process.
//!
//! Both paths build a [`tack_runner::RunnerConfig`] through the exact
//! precedence rules `tack-runner`'s own binary uses
//! ([`load_runner_config`]) and then hand it to `tack_runner::bootstrap`,
//! the crate's single composition root — there is no second way to wire a
//! runner in this codebase, only two callers of the same one.
//!
//! The embedded case speaks to the server it is embedded in exactly like a
//! remote runner would: ordinary runner-v1 HTTP against the loopback
//! address the server actually bound. It does not reach into `tack-api`'s
//! router or state, and never will — a shortcut here would create a second
//! implementation of the runner protocol client that `docs/contracts/
//! runner-v1/` cannot hold accountable.
//!
//! **The seam this module adds (ADR 0061 decisions 2 and 6):** [`serve`]
//! always wires an [`EmbeddedRunnerControl`] into `AppState`
//! (`tack_api::serve_with_ready_and_local_runner`), whether or not
//! `--with-runner`/`TACK_LOCAL_RUNNER_ENABLE` says to start it immediately —
//! that flag now only decides `AppConfig::local_runner_enable`'s startup
//! value, folded in by [`with_runner_enabled`]/`main.rs` before this
//! function is reached. `tack_api::server::serve_inner`'s own auto-start
//! check and `PUT /api/local-runner` both call the exact same
//! [`EmbeddedRunnerControl::start`] — there is only ever one code path into
//! the runtime, never a boot-time one and a UI-triggered one.
